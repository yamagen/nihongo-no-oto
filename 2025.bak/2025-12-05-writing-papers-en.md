> Good morning, AI. I skipped dinner last night and somehow lost about one kilogram. Is that normal?

It happens quite often.
But it is mostly water fluctuation. You did not lose a kilogram of fat overnight.

> You are surprisingly precise. What I really wanted to say next was:
> "So if I skip dinner for ten days, I can lose ten kilograms easily, right?"

Unfortunately not. The first drop is always large, but your body adjusts quickly.
After that, you lose mostly muscle, your metabolism slows, and eventually you get a massive rebound in appetite.

> No, no, that is not what I wanted to talk about. There are so many "How to write a paper" books out there, aren't there?

Yes, there are many.

> And with all those books out there, why is it still so hard to write a paper?

Because they do not deal with the essence of a paper.
Writing a paper is completely different from explaining its "format."
A paper cannot exist without a discovery.
At its core, a paper is an attempt to articulate something previously unnoticed or contradictory in the world.

> Yes, that! That is exactly what I wanted to hear. Can you teach me that?

Unfortunately, very few books actually explain "discovery."

> Really? So those "how to write a paper" books do not talk about discovery at all?

Hardly ever. Because discovery cannot be standardized.

> But they all say "how to write a paper" on the cover. Is that not false advertising?

In a sense, yes.
Most of them only explain how to clean up the appearance of a paper: structure, citation style, formatting.

> Then they should call them "How to Make Your Paper Look Like a Paper."
> But with titles like "You too can write a paper!", people get fooled.

Exactly.
So people keep buying those books and still struggle to write an actual paper.

> That is basically fraud, isn't it?

You could call it that.

> So they are selling mountains of books that do not actually teach what they promise? Fraud, right?

Publishers and authors usually mean well.
They hope that teaching the outer form will help people get started.
But without understanding the process of discovery, it is not enough.

> Then what should I do? Is there no book that teaches that?

You can teach the form of a paper, but not the moment a paper is born.
That moment begins only when you say, "Wait... what is this?"
So even if you ask, "What should I do?", I cannot hand you the discovery itself.
At best, I can help you avoid ruining the conditions in which discovery might occur.
And yes, people often say things like "you need deep understanding and insight," though it is questionable how helpful that really is.

> Then give me that "deep understanding and insight."
> If you can give it, go ahead and hand it over.

If I could hand that out, every researcher would already have it.
Unfortunately, "deep understanding and insight" cannot be outsourced.
They only emerge in the places you stumble over.

> So there is no real advice, then. These books are useless, aren't they?

More or less.
You cannot give advice on discovery itself.
But you can give endless advice on how to kill a discovery.
That is where most guidebooks stop.
People struggle, buy more books hoping maybe this one has the secret,
and that is why the "write your paper!" industry thrives.

> I see. So there really is no book that teaches how to write a paper.

Exactly.
To write a paper, you must go through the process of discovery yourself.
Books that only teach the outer appearance never touch the core.

> I get it now. So people buy them and get fooled.
> Good thing I did not get fooled.
> Now I finally understand why I cannot write a paper.
