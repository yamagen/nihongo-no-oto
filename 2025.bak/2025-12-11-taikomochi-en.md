# IG / AG and Their Correspondence to System 1 / System 2

Last updated: 2025/12/11-21:15:59

## Summary

This article aligns Immediate Grammar (IG) and Adjustive Grammar (AG) with the dual-process theory of System 1 and System 2, proposing a unified conceptual framework for understanding human language production and AI response generation.

- IG (Immediate Grammar) = System 1 processing
  - Reflexive, fast, tolerant of inconsistency, grounded in bodily rhythm

- AG (Adjustive Grammar) = System 2 processing
  - Integrative, context-maintaining, coherence-oriented, slower but stable

In addition, by comparing the behavior of a traditional _hokan_ (professional jester/entertainer) and AI, we illustrate how two agents can perform the same interpersonal function while relying on different layers of processing.

## What is a "hokan"?

A _hokan_ is a traditional male entertainer who boosts the mood of guests at banquets, matching their utterances instantly and keeping the flow of conversation smooth.
The hokan's speech is inherently IG-like: it prioritizes rhythm, timing, and social temperature over logical consistency.

## Example: "Instant improvisation of a hokan"

> Guest: "It is hot today."  
> Hokan: "Indeed it is. So hot that I forgot to wear my fundoshi today."  
> Guest: "But this room is a bit cold."  
> Hokan: "Yes, yes, so cold that I regret forgetting my fundoshi."  
> Guest: "Still, this level of cold is tolerable."  
> Hokan: "Oh, cold never bothered me. I am tough, you know."  
> Guest: "But your nose is running."  
> Hokan: "No, no, this is just some shochu coming back out of my nose from earlier."  
> Guest: "You idiot. Stop forcing yourself."

## What this example illustrates

This exchange highlights the core properties of IG-driven language use:

- Instantaneous responses (within one beat)
- Full alignment with the interlocutor's utterance
- No concern for contradiction
- Maintaining the "temperature" and momentum of the conversation
- Highly improvisational and bodily
- A pure example of System 1 / IG processing

A hokan is not crafting "content"; he is crafting "the atmosphere of interaction."

| Framework    | Immediacy / Automaticity | Structural Control | Primary Role                               | Examples                                    |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **IG**       | High                     | Low                | Rhythmic response, interpersonal synchrony | Hokan replies, natural talk, backchannels   |
| **AG**       | Low                      | High               | Explanation, coherence, formality          | AI responses, teacher explanations, writing |
| **System 1** | High                     | Low                | Intuition, quick reactions                 | Emotional reactions, split-second judgments |
| **System 2** | Low                      | High               | Reasoning, integration                     | Logical thinking, editing, reinterpretation |

### Summary of correspondence

- IG is the linguistic manifestation of System 1.
- AG is the linguistic manifestation of System 2.

Figure 1: Integrated correspondence of IG / AG with System 1 / System 2

## IG as System 1 processing

- Bodily, rhythmic, breath-based
- Reflexive, instantaneous
- Only the immediate flow is referenced
- Contradictions are not problematic
- Prosody, timing, and "temperature" govern behavior

Examples:

- Hokan's shifting replies
- Conversation steering
- Backchanneling and "ma" (timing)

## AG as System 2 processing

- Maintains context
- Ensures coherence
- Generates explanations
- Operates across long spans of discourse

Examples:

- AI responses
- Classroom explanations
- Written language

## Shared core

Despite different processing styles, both IG and AG serve the same overarching purpose:

**to maintain and enhance interpersonal coordination.**

## Theoretical conclusion

> IG is the linguistic embodiment of System 1.
> AG is the linguistic embodiment of System 2.

> A hokan is a master of IG (System 1).
> AI is a master of AG (System 2).

Applying dual-process theory to linguistics allows both human and AI behavior to be visualized on the same conceptual plane, clarifying the two-axis structure of PGM: immediacy and adjustiveness.
