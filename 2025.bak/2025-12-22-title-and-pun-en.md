# Immediate Comprehension to Polysemous Appreciation: A Processual Approach to Meaning Understanding

Last updated: 2025/12/22-13:11:32

## Abstract

This paper proposes a two-layer structure in language comprehension, consisting of an immediate reading that is established instantly and a subsequent adjustment reading. As a specific example, it demonstrates a case where, under practical constraints of file naming, even when punctuation and delimiters are removed from the original subtitle, the reading converges immediately to a univocal interpretation. Building on this, the paper examines the process of appreciating puns in Japanese waka poetry, first establishing univocal understanding as a phonetic chain, followed by polysemous appreciation through syntactic organization. Through these examples, it elucidates how language users process written information and subsequently adjust it, offering a process-based perspective against the traditional dichotomy of univocity and polysemy.

## Main Text

### 1. Introduction

We have traditionally discussed univocity and polysemy in language primarily through the analysis of sentences and syntax. In particular, when multiple interpretations are theoretically possible, they have been regarded as "ambiguity" or "polysemy," raising questions about how to describe structural determination and semantic branching. However, these discussions often fail to adequately address how language users actually read and at what point understanding is established.

This paper addresses a problem that arises not in the realm of theoretical discussion but in very everyday practice. Specifically, it concerns a situation where, in the task of naming video files, punctuation and delimiters were removed from the originally assigned subtitles, resulting in a continuous string of characters. This operation was due to management convenience and was not intended for semantic considerations. However, it was confirmed that even with such delimiters removed, Japanese speakers read the strings without hesitation, and understanding was established immediately.

The issue at hand is not how the expression can be theoretically decomposed, but how it is actually processed. The fact that reading is established without interruption despite the absence of explicit delimiters suggests that language comprehension does not necessarily presuppose a univocal determination of structure. This observation highlights the need to focus on the order and temporal process in which understanding is established, in contrast to traditional discussions surrounding univocity and polysemy.

Starting from such everyday practice, this paper reexamines the process of language comprehension from the perspective of a two-layer structure that distinguishes between immediately established readings and subsequent adjustment readings. First, it examines the establishment of reading in file names, and then it addresses the process of understanding puns found in Japanese waka poetry, clarifying the relationship between immediate univocal understanding and subsequent polysemous appreciation.

### 2. Removing Punctuation and Delimiters from Subtitles

The operation performed in the file naming task described in the previous section involved removing punctuation, middle dots, parentheses, and other symbols from the originally provided subtitles. This decision was not intended for the analysis of linguistic expressions or semantic interpretation but was made solely for practical reasons related to file management. Symbols can often complicate handling depending on the environment and can hinder search and automated processing. Therefore, a file name composed only of basic character elements such as kana, kanji, numbers, and spaces was chosen.

The resulting string from this operation could be evaluated as structurally ambiguous from a traditional grammatical perspective, as it lacks explicit delimiters. However, in actual use, contrary to such evaluations, Japanese speakers read the string immediately and understand it without particular difficulty. What is important here is that the format of a file name does not presuppose interpretation as a sentence or utterance. A file name functions as a label to identify and manage the object, rather than as an expression to explain its content.

In this sense, the language used in file names is not meant to precisely describe semantic content but to carry the minimum information necessary for identification. The emotional, rhetorical elements, and explanatory functions contained in the subtitles are not essential for the purpose of file naming; rather, their omission enhances operational stability. What is being performed here is not the deletion of meaning but the separation of roles assigned to language.

That is, the original role of the subtitle was to evoke viewers' expectations and preview the content, constituting part of the appreciation itself. On the other hand, the role required in a file name is to uniquely identify the object and ensure it can be reliably retrieved later. The operation of removing subtitles can be seen as a result of not conflating these two roles, effectively rearranging linguistic expressions according to their intended use.

The fact that the string with removed delimiters is still read immediately and understood univocally indicates that language comprehension does not always depend on complete structural representation or explicit segmentation. Rather, language users process the given string according to the context and purpose of its use, where language as a "management label" supports immediate understanding.

### 3. The Moment It Is Called "Ambiguous"

As described in the previous section, the string with removed delimiters is read without issue in actual usage contexts, and understanding is established. However, the moment such strings are analyzed, they are often evaluated as "ambiguous" or "polysemously interpretable." This evaluation arises not from the context in which the expression is used but rather as a result of invoking a specific analytical framework.

Traditional grammatical analysis treats expressions as sentences in principle, presupposing a univocal determination of syntactic structure. Therefore, for strings without explicit delimiters, questions arise about where segmentation occurs and which words modify which others. At this point, analysts enumerate theoretically possible multiple segmentations and dependencies, attempting to illustrate "ambiguity" by diagramming them. The act of drawing so-called syntax trees is a typical manifestation of this.

The questions raised at this stage are not necessarily required by the original role of the expression. The string used as a file name is not intended to be interpreted as a sentence or to have its semantic relationships explicitly structured. Nevertheless, when the framework of grammatical analysis is applied, questions such as "Which interpretation is correct?" and "Is the structure univocally determined?" are automatically generated.

The issue here does not stem from the nature of the expression itself but from a mismatch between the analytical assumptions and the subject. By subsequently demanding univocity of structure for expressions where understanding has already been established, "ambiguity" is artificially created. In this sense, the moment it is called "ambiguous" is precisely when the perspective that prioritizes formal description comes to the forefront, detached from the actual practice of language use.

Under such circumstances, the question of how understanding was established recedes into the background, replaced by the question of how it can be described. However, this paper is concerned with the former rather than the latter. That is, the purpose of this paper is to clarify how language users actually process information by distinguishing between situations where structure must be determined and those where it does not.

### 4. The Fact That It Is Readable

As mentioned in the previous section, in analytical contexts, "ambiguity" or "polysemy" may be pointed out. However, prior to such assertions, what needs to be confirmed is the fact that the string in question is actually read without issue. For example, even with strings lacking delimiters, Japanese speakers immediately read them as coherent units such as "namida no daigyakuten" (great reversal of tears) or "nakama o shinjite kiseki o okose" (believe in comrades and create miracles) upon visual recognition. This reading is established in one go, without trial and error or hesitation.

The fact indicates that reading is established even without prior explicit segmentation. If segmentation were truly indeterminate and multiple interpretations were competing simultaneously, reading comprehension would halt or at least involve discomfort or hesitation. However, in reality, such reactions do not occur. Reading proceeds smoothly, without any phonetic or semantic breakdown. In this regard, segmentation is not something provided by analysis but is established within the process of reading itself.

The important question here is where segmentation is determined. The fact that reading is established despite the absence of delimiters or syntactic markers suggests that the determination of segmentation is not performed externally to the string, i.e., by the analyst's operation, but rather occurs within the immediate processing of the language user. Factors such as lexical knowledge, phonetic grouping, and semantic prediction interact with each other, allowing reading to naturally converge into a single form.

Thus, the very fact that reading does not stop can be said to be evidence that immediate understanding is established univocally. Univocity is not obtained as a result of explicitly determining structure but appears as the fact that reading proceeded without interruption. This point is positioned as a starting point for considering language comprehension in this paper. In other words, rather than asking "how can it be interpreted polysemously," it is essential to ask "how is it first read univocally" to capture the process of understanding.

### 5. When Does Univocity Establish?

We assure that univocity is established in the initial stage of understanding, as reading converges without interruption. The question to be reconsidered here is when and under what conditions univocity is established.

First, we must confirm the univocity in the context where language is used. The string presented as a file name functions without causing misunderstandings or confusion in actual operation. The reader processes the presented string immediately and understands it as a specific unit. At this stage, no other readings or interpretations are competing simultaneously, and understanding converges into a single form. The univocity established here is not unambiguity in a strict syntactic sense but is based on the fact that processing proceeded without interruption.

On the other hand, the situation is different in the context of analysis. When an expression is extracted as an object of analysis, theoretically possible segmentations and interpretations are enumerated and compared. At this time, polysemy arises by deliberately reintroducing other possibilities that were naturally excluded during use. In other words, polysemy is not something that existed from the beginning in the process of understanding but is created later at the request of analysis after understanding has been established.

Without distinguishing these two stages, univocity and polysemy tend to be regarded as opposing concepts. However, in reality, they belong to different time axes. Univocal understanding is established during use, followed by the construction of polysemous interpretations at the stage of analysis or reflection. Considering this order, univocity and polysemy are not mutually exclusive but can be positioned as different aspects of a continuous process.

Thus, the issue addressed in this paper is not a choice between which of univocity or polysemy is correct. What is important is to distinguish when and under what conditions each arises. From this perspective, it becomes possible to describe both the fact that understanding is established and the process by which meaning proliferates through analysis without contradiction.

### 6. Switching Processing Modes

In the previous section, we demonstrated that univocity and polysemy belong to different temporal axes and do not need to be viewed as opposites. In this section, we organize this difference as a distinction in the standpoint of language users, namely, the difference in processing modes. Here, processing modes refer to the different attitudes of understanding that the same individual can take toward the same linguistic expression.

First, when facing expressions as a Japanese language user, the purpose of understanding is to grasp meaning immediately and move interactions or actions forward. In this mode, the presented string is processed as a single unit, and whether reading is established takes precedence. Whether delimiters or structures are explicitly indicated is a secondary issue, and as long as reading does not stop, understanding is judged to be successful. The understanding established at this stage does not involve conscious analysis but is by no means incomplete.

Oh the other hand, when facing expressions as an analyst, the purpose is different. Here, it is required to objectify the already established understanding and explain what structures or factors made that understanding possible. Therefore, other segmentations or interpretive possibilities that were not apparent during use are intentionally extracted and become subjects of comparison and organization. Through this operation, polysemy and ambiguity are visualized, but this does not indicate that understanding was insufficient; rather, it is the result of switching perspectives for analysis.

If we confuse these two processing modes, expressions that were understandable may be evaluated as "ambiguous" or "not univocally determined," creating the appearance of a contradiction. However, in reality, it is merely the same individual viewing the same object from different standpoints. Understanding as a Japanese language user and reconstruction as an analyst are not mutually exclusive but can be switched in order.

Thus, the situation we have dealt with in this paper, where "it is readable but said to be ambiguous," is not a contradiction of language comprehension itself. It stems from the unconscious back-and-forth between the two processing modes of use and analysis, with their distinction not being made explicit. By consciously capturing the switching of processing modes, it becomes possible to position immediate univocal understanding and subsequent polysemous reconstruction within the same framework without contradiction.

### 7. Repositioning of Kakekotoba (Puns)

The kakekotoba (puns) in waka poetry have traditionally been treated as a rhetorical technique representing polysemy in the Japanese language. Generally, it is explained that multiple meanings are superimposed simultaneously on a single phonetic chain, and readers grasp them concurrently. However, such explanations do not adequately reflect actual reading experiences or the order of understanding.

As confirmed in the previous section, language comprehension progresses based on an immediately established reading. From this perspective, even in the case of kakekotoba, what readers first experience is not polysemous fluctuation but the first reading that naturally flows as a phonetic chain. Since waka poetry is premised on being read aloud, for the flow not to be interrupted, understanding must converge univocally at the initial stage. If multiple meanings were competing simultaneously from the first reading stage, the phonetic chain would stagnate, and the flow as waka would not be established.

The first immediate reading selects the most natural interpretation based on context and lexical constraints. At this stage, the technique of kakekotoba may not be consciously recognized, and readers grasp the entire waka according to a specific meaning. The important point is that this reading is not incomplete but provides a sufficient foundation for understanding the waka.

The polysemy of kakekotoba is recognized at a subsequent stage. By pausing and reflecting on the words and syntax, readers realize that the same phonetic chain can correspond to other words or meanings. At this time, the initial reading is not negated but retained, with new meanings superimposed. What is being performed here is not a correction of immediate understanding but an adjustment and expansion of understanding, and the appreciation of kakekotoba is established through this second and subsequent operations.

Thus, kakekotoba is not an expression understood polysemously from the beginning. Rather, it can be said to be an expression that produces polysemous effects by layering subsequent adjustments on top of an immediately established univocal reading. The essence of kakekotoba lies not in simultaneous polysemy but in incorporating a temporal difference in the process of understanding. This repositioning allows kakekotoba to be seamlessly situated within a two-layer structure consisting of immediate understanding and adjusted understanding.

### 8. Polysemy as a Temporal Difference

We have traditionally discussed polysemy as "simultaneous polysemy." This perspective holds that a single expression carries multiple meanings at the same time, coexisting in parallel. However, this explanation lacks consideration of how understanding actually progresses. Language users must first reach a single understanding before they can continue reading or listening, rather than processing multiple meanings simultaneously.

The kakekotoba was frequently cited as a typical example of simultaneous polysemy. However, as discussed in the previous section, the appreciation of kakekotoba involves first establishing a univocal understanding, followed by recognizing additional meanings through reflection. This process indicates that polysemy arises not from simultaneous coexistence but from a temporal sequence in understanding.

On considering this order of meaning increase, the necessity of "first passing through" becomes clear. If univocal understanding is not established in the initial stage, subsequent adjustments and appreciation cannot proceed. For the flow as a phonetic chain or reading as written information to progress without interruption, immediate convergence is essential. Polysemy functions only on the premise of this immediate understanding and is not a factor that hinders comprehension.

On the basis of the processing order described above, the necessity of what it means for an utterance to "first pass" becomes clear. If univocal understanding is not achieved at the initial stage, it is impossible to proceed to subsequent processes of adjustment or appreciation. In order for the flow of the utterance as a sound chain, as well as the processing of written information, to continue without interruption, immediate convergence is indispensable. Polysemy functions only on the basis of such immediate understanding; it presupposes univocity rather than obstructing it.

Therefore, treating polysemy as a simultaneous property entails the risk of reversing the process of understanding. What this paper proposes is to position polysemy as a domain of possibilities that opens only after understanding has been established. From this perspective, univocal understanding and polysemous appreciation are not opposed to one another, but can be described in a unified way as a continuous process unfolding across different temporal phases.

### 9. A Two-Layer Process Grammar Model

The cases examined in this paper all demonstrate that language comprehension does not conclude in a single stage, but is established through two temporally distinct phases. To account for this, the present study adopts a Process Grammar Model that conceptualizes language comprehension as a two-layer structure consisting of **an immediate layer** and **an adjustive layer**.

The immediate layer refers to the level of processing that language users carry out instantaneously in response to a presented phonetic chain or string of characters. At this level, the highest priority is that reading or listening proceeds without interruption, and understanding converges univocally. Segmentation and the selection of meaning are not consciously manipulated, but are automatically established on the basis of lexical knowledge and contextual prediction. If understanding fails to be established at this immediate layer, it is not possible to proceed to subsequent reflection or analysis.

By contrast, the adjustive layer refers to the stage at which the understanding established in the immediate layer is objectified, reflected upon, and reconstructed. At this level, alternative segmentations and interpretive possibilities are consciously taken up, and polysemous meanings are constructed. Crucially, the operations carried out in the adjustive layer do not negate the understanding established at the immediate layer. Rather, the adjustive layer presupposes the results of the immediate layer and functions to overlay and extend meaning upon that basis.

By adopting this two-layer structure, the strain found in many traditional discussions can be resolved. For example, situations in which a text is readable yet evaluated as "ambiguous" stem from a failure to distinguish between understanding at the immediate layer and analysis at the adjustive layer. The apparent opposition between univocity and polysemy likewise arose from the lack of explicit recognition that these phenomena belong to different layers. Introducing a two-layer structure makes it possible to describe, within a single framework and without contradiction, both the fact that understanding is established and the process through which meaning proliferates.

This perspective can be consistently applied to all the cases examined in this paper. In the case of file names, understanding as a management label is established at the immediate layer, which in turn enables syntactic and semantic analysis at the adjustive layer. The removal of punctuation marks and other symbols indicating word boundaries provides an example showing that understanding can be established at the immediate layer as long as the conditions necessary for processing are satisfied. In the case of kakekotoba, once an initial reading is established at the immediate layer, polysemous appreciation is carried out at the adjustive layer. In this way, contemporary practices and classical expressions alike can be positioned continuously within a shared framework of a two-layer structure.

As demonstrated above, the two-layer Process Grammar Model conceptualizes language comprehension not as a static structure, but as a chain of processing that unfolds over time. Through this model, immediate understanding that first "passes" and subsequent understanding that adjusts and appreciates meaning are clearly articulated as complementary processes.

### 10. Conclusion

In this paper, starting from the everyday practice of file naming, we have consistently examined a range of phenomena, including the deletion of punctuation marks and other symbols indicating word boundaries, the establishment of readable understanding, the relationship between univocity and polysemy, and kakekotoba in waka poetry, from the perspective of how understanding is established and in what order. What emerges from this examination is that language comprehension does not conclude with the grasp of static structures, but must instead be understood as a process consisting of immediate processing followed by subsequent adjustment.

From this perspective, the scope of grammar itself must also be reconsidered. Traditional grammatical descriptions have demonstrated considerable explanatory power in situations where structures are made explicit and univocal relationships are fixed. However, not all instances of language use require such determination. In file names, subtitles, and even in the initial reading of waka poetry, what matters is that understanding is established immediately, and structural univocity is not a necessary condition. Grammar should therefore be treated by distinguishing between situations in which it functions as a tool for explaining an understanding that has already been established and those in which it functions to support understanding itself.

Moreover, a description aligned with human understanding does not consist in exhaustively listing all possible interpretations, but rather in describing at what stage and in what form understanding emerges. The two-layer Process Grammar Model presented in this paper provides a framework for capturing univocity and polysemy not as opposing concepts, but as successive phases within a continuous process, by distinguishing immediate understanding that first "passes" from the subsequent stages of adjustment and appreciation.

From this perspective, evaluations such as "ambiguous" or "polysemous" are shown to arise not from the inherent nature of language itself, but from which processing mode is presupposed. By grounding grammatical description in the everyday practices of understanding carried out by language users, grammar can be repositioned in a form that is more closely aligned with human comprehension processes. What this paper has offered is one perspective toward that end.
