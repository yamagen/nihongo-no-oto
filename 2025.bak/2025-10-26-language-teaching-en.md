### Learning, Joy, and the Role of the Language Teacher

---

## Introduction

In language education, what is the most important thing? This has been a question that has lingered in my mind for a long time as someone who has been involved in language education. There are many theories, methods, and techniques. But ultimately, isn't the essence of learning found in the moment when a person "becomes able to do something"?... I have come to think so.

In this article, I would like to share my experiences and philosophy as a language teacher regarding "using," "understanding," "being able to do," "forgetting," and "becoming able to do again," interspersed with everyday episodes.

---

## 1. Using Comes First

In language education, the first and foremost priority should be "using." This also means letting students "use" the language. Even if they don't understand, they should try to use it anyway. Language acquisition only arises from that experience.

---

## 2. Understanding Comes After

Understanding comes after using, which is to say, understanding is a sensation that comes after the experience of using. It is not something given by the teacher, but something the learner acquires through their own experience.

---

## 3. Like Riding a Bicycle

In explaining this to students, I often use the example of a bicycle. Even if you don't understand the structure of a bicycle, anyone can learn to ride it. Knowing the structure is meaningless unless you actually ride it. Language is exactly the same.

---

## 4. Language Is Not Knowledge, But Skill

Speaking a language is not supported by knowledge of the language. It is a skill. Skills can only be acquired through use.

---

## 5. "Understanding" Is a Feeling

Understanding is a mysterious thing, which cannot be taught by others. By using it yourself, you feel, "Ah, I might have understood it." That feeling is the core of learning.

---

## 6. 「わからない」から「わかる」へ

## 6. From "Not Understanding" to "Understanding"

The fact that there is a moment of "understanding" means that there was a state of "not understanding" before it. It is in that moment of change that the joy of learning exists.

---

## 7. "I Understand!" Is Joyful

When a person thinks, "I understand!", it is a joyful moment. Even without a logical causal relationship, "understanding" and "joy" are connected. There is no reason not to use that emotion in education.

---

## 8. "I Did It!" Is Even Greater

Beyond just understanding, there is an even deeper joy in the moment when one realizes they have "become able to do something they couldn't do before."

---

## 9. Human Life Is a Series of "Becoming Able to Do Something"

I believe that this moment is the very reason why people learn. Human life is a series of experiences of "becoming able to do something." Starting from making fire, writing characters, to floating boats; all began from things that "could not be done" at first.

---

## 10. This Is a Timeless Principle

The accumulation of these joyful moments has created human life, history, and civilization.

---

## 11. We Are Already in It

It is so obvious that we forget the joy of "becoming able to do something."

---

## 12. Driver's License and "Becoming Able to Do Something"

Do you remember the moment you received your driver's license for the first time? You were so happy then, but now it has blended into your daily life.

---

## 13. Not Technology, But Skill

Driving is not about theory, but a "skill" ingrained in the body. Language is the same.

---

## 14. Even Just a Greeting

You could say "Good morning" in Japanese for the first time. Just that alone made you happy. The first step is a just small and trivial, but you would feel a definite moment of "I did it!"

---

## 15. But Humans Forget Quickly

Even though we were so happy to have achieved something, after a few days, it becomes "normal." Joy does not last forever.

---

## 16. The Role of the Teacher

That is why the role of the teacher is important. According to the student's ability, the teacher gives tasks that include a little bit of "things they cannot do," and watches over the moment of "I did it!"

---

## 17. Classes Are Places to Design Moments of "Becoming Able to Do Something"

To ensure that moments of "becoming able to do something" continue to occur, classes should be carefully designed.

---

## 18. Designing Is Not Easy

Each teacher's work is painstaking and difficult, requiring deep knowledge of the language, understanding of the students' comprehension levels, preparation of teaching materials... and that is precisely what makes it valuable.

---

## 19. Are Language Teachers Superhumans?

Yes, language teachers are superhumans. As a language teacher myself, this is not an exaggeration. It is a job that involves accumulating unseen efforts and quietly witnessing the moments of joy in students.

---

## 20. 覚えていてくれない

## 20. Students Don't Remember

Even if miracles happen, students forget them by the next week. But that's okay.

---

## 21. Even If They Say, "Who Are You?"

It is natural for students to forget their teachers when they meet again after several years. As a teacher, it may be a little sad, but that is also the nature of education.

---

## 22. It Is Just Right for Language Teachers to Be Forgotten

Students should remember their academic advisors. If only fun memories with language teachers remain, then the purpose of studying abroad has not been fulfilled.

---

## 23. But We Are There, in the Backstage

We are not the main characters, but we support the moments of "I did it!" from the backstage. That is the role of language teachers.

---

## Conclusion: The Accumulation Is a Skill

Such as riding a bicycle, language is also a skill. Once you have "become able to do something," it becomes normal and fades from memory.

However, continuing to create those moments of "becoming able to do something" is the work of language teachers, and that will never change.

Even if forgotten, it's okay. Even if not remembered, it's okay. If it remains as language and becomes established as a skill, that is education.

## Afterword

This article is a candid expression of what I have felt in my daily involvement in language education. If there is a moment somewhere that reminds you of your own "I did it!", I would be very happy.

# Article Script for a Lecture

## Title: "What It Means to 'Be Able to Do Something'"

### Learning, Joy, and the Role of the Language Teacher

---

### 1. Introduction

Today, I would like to talk about "what it means to become able to do something." Through my experience in language education, I have come to realize the importance of this, and I would like to share my thoughts on it.

---

### 2. Using Comes First

The primary goal of language education is, after all, "using" the language. More specifically, it is about "letting students use" the language. It is okay if they don't understand it. What matters is that they try to use it.

You might think, "What? That's too rough!" But I believe that "using even without understanding" is far more important.

---

### 3. 自転車の話

### 3. The Bicycle Story

When I tell this to my students, I often use the example of a "bicycle." Even if you don't know the structure of a bicycle, everyone can ride it, right? But if you only learn the theory, you cannot ride it.

Learning a language is the same. Speaking is not a matter of knowledge, but a matter of "skill."

---

### 4. The Experience of "Understanding"

"Understanding" is a mysterious thing. It cannot be taught by others.

The moment you use it yourself and feel, "Ah, I see," that is "understanding." Therefore, "understanding" is a sensation that comes after the experience of using.

---

### 5. 「わかる」と「よろこび」

### 5. "Understanding" and "Joy"

When you understand something and feel happy, that is the joy of learning.
It is very queer that "understanding" and "joy" have no logical connection. Yet, somehow, when people think, "I understand," they smile.

If you are an educator, you should not miss the opportunity to use this "joy."

---

### 6. The Moment of "I Did It!"

Beyond just "understanding," there is an even greater joy. That is the moment when you realize, "I was able to do something I couldn't do before."

I believe that the moment of "I did it!" is the very reason why people learn. In human life, it is the accumulation of experiences of "becoming able to do something." Making fire, writing characters, floating boats; all began from things that "could not be done" at first.

---

### 7. Humans Forget

Having said that, humans are forgetful creatures. Even after struggling so hard to "become able to do something," they quickly forget that moment.

Please remember the moment when you got your driver's license. On the day you received it, you were so happy that you kept looking at it again and again. But now, you don't do that anymore.

That's right. Driving is not "technology," but "skill." Once it becomes ingrained in your body, you no longer need to consciously think about it. Language is exactly the same.

---

### 8. 教師の仕事とは

### 8. The Role of the Teacher

So, the role of the teacher is to create moments of "becoming able to do something." According to the student's ability, the teacher gives tasks that are just a little bit challenging. Then, they watch over the moment of "I did it!"

What we call a class is "a place to design moments of becoming able to do something." However, this is not an easy task.

Each teacher's work requires deep knowledge of the language, assessing the appropriate level for each student, preparing teaching materials, and paying attention to every word. The job of a teacher is more delicate and requires more patience than one might imagine.

---

### 9. Are Teachers Superhumans?

I think that sometimes, teachers are truly "superhumans." While conducting multiple classes every day, they observe each student's expressions and witness the moment when, in their hearts, they think, "Yes, they did it now."

However, we pay a great deal of unseen effort to create those moments. Students may not realize it, and forget it quickly.

---

### 10. It's Okay to Be Forgotten

I once ran into a former international student whom I had taught Japanese. When I greeted them with "How have you been?" they looked at me with a face that said, "Who are you?" (laughs).

I felt at that moment. It is just right for language teachers to be forgotten. What international students should remember is their academic advisors. If the memories of their Japanese teachers are the most prominent, then perhaps their study abroad experience itself was a failure.

---

### 11. Teachers in the Backstage

We, language teachers, are not the main characters. We are in the backstage, watching over the moments when students feel, "I did it!" I believe that this position is the essence of education.

---

### 12. Conclusion

Such as riding a bicycle, language is also a skill. Once you have "become able to do something," it becomes normal and fades from memory.

However, the accumulation of these moments creates people and society. And it is we teachers who support that.

Even if forgotten, it's okay. Even if not remembered, it's okay. If it remains as language and becomes established as a skill, that is education.

This is what I believe "becoming able to do something" means.

This talk is a culmination of what I have felt in my daily interactions with students. If it serves as a trigger for you to recall your own moments of "I did it!", then that alone makes today's discussion worthwhile.
