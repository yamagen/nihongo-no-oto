# **"PGM Is Not a New Term": The Theoretical Role of the Process Grammar Model**

Last updated: 2025/11/27-21:40:00

## **Summary**

The Process Grammar Model is not a new label introduced to replace existing grammatical concepts. Its core claim is that linguistic structure must be centered on the temporality of speech, and that the two psychological processes involved in speaking, immediate reactions and adjusted reactions, should be treated as distinct descriptive units. This article explains how PGM fills the theoretical gaps in existing frameworks and why it should be understood not as a terminological innovation but as a new observational method.

# **Main Text**

The Process Grammar Model is not primarily the name of a new linguistic theory. It is an observational framework designed to capture how utterances unfold in time. Here, time is not a simple chronological sequence but a continuum that includes both the psychological processing at the moment an utterance is produced and the delayed, reflective processing that follows it. This temporal dimension has not been adequately addressed in traditional grammatical theories.

Conventional grammatical frameworks tend to describe sentences as static systems. Generative grammar focuses on formal structure, cognitive grammar emphasizes networks of conceptual meaning, and discourse studies investigate the relations between sentences across stretches of text. Yet none of these theories has treated the reactive and breath-level structures that operate at the moment of speech as central analytical targets. These structures, however, are crucial when observing actual linguistic behavior.

PGM introduces a shift in perspective by redefining grammar as a process. Grammar is not a system but a set of processing mechanisms that operate dynamically in time. Within this process, there are two distinct layers: an immediate layer that supports fast, reactive behaviors, and an adjusted layer that supports slower, reflective operations. These layers differ in structure, cognitive load, and processing speed. This distinction is not a matter of naming but reflects observable differences in linguistic behavior.

For example, immediate reactions can be seen in modern Japanese response tokens, in the call-and-response patterns found in classical literature, and in the daily expressions recorded in AEAD. In contrast, the shaping of sentences, revision, and socially appropriate formulation require a different processing sequence. PGM offers a unified framework that both distinguishes and integrates these two layers as parts of a single continuum of linguistic action.

Thus, the Process Grammar Model is not simply a renamed version of existing grammatical theories. It is an observational method that allows previously untheorized aspects of speech, namely immediacy and adjustment, to be described systematically on the basis of empirical data. Its originality lies not in terminology but in the redirection of analytical focus, enabling a coherent explanation of linguistic phenomena that extend from classical texts to contemporary spoken interactions.
