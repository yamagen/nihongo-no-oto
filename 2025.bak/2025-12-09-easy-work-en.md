## Summary

To many people, the work of a researcher looks difficult, specialized, and heavy. But there are fields where you don't need giant machines, hazardous chemicals,
animal experiments, or elaborate psychological tests.
All you need is a small laptop, some electricity, a cup of coffee,
and maybe a Black Thunder chocolate bar.
When research settles naturally into your daily rhythm and becomes part of your own way of living, the job begins to feel like a surprisingly 'easy trade.'
This short essay reflects on that feeling—without turning it into anything grand.

## Main Text

When people imagine a researcher in the sciences, they often picture huge machines humming in a lab, precise measurements of chemicals, white coats, and a flurry of controlled experiments.

My work is nothing like that.

The tools I use are a modest laptop costing around thirty thousand yen and a split keyboard that fits my hands perfectly.
There are no large-scale experiments that require massive funding.
If I can pay my electricity bill, the work more or less proceeds.

And so each day I do what I enjoy:
brewing coffee, taking a bite of Black Thunder,
reading classical Japanese texts, adjusting dictionary files,
writing small programs, and preparing for classes.
These actions are woven into my daily life so naturally
that I sometimes forget they are part of my job.

It is genuinely strange that I can live this way
and still receive a salary from a university.
It sounds like a joke, but it is not.
I often find myself murmuring,
"Well, this is unbelievable,"
while sipping my coffee.

But there is nothing profound hidden in this "lightness."  
It simply happens that my field does not require
machines, chemicals, or experimental subjects.
There is no lofty story of deep curiosity or spiritual attainment here.
I just happened to choose a line of work
that can be done with a computer and a cup of coffee.

Before I noticed, the boundary between work and daily life had faded.
Still, I would not call this some kind of special "milestone."
I sit at my desk, read some classical text when I feel like it,
drink coffee when I lose focus, and return to the work again.

That this routine results in a paycheck remains one of the small mysteries of my life.
And so today, too, I continue my easy trade; supported only by a computer, some electricity, and a bit of sweet chocolate.
