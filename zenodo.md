## Overview

_Nihongo Notes – Sounds of Japanese_ is a bilingual series of reflections on the expressions, grammar, and communicative structures of the Japanese language. Each entry records a single insight or observation from everyday use, poetic phrasing, or classical literature, written from the perspective of a linguist working at the boundary between description and interpretation.

Vol.1 comprises the first set of entries written between April and May 2025, covering both intuitive utterances and structural phenomena. The series takes inspiration from grammatical immediacy, poetic ellipsis, and the unspoken dimension of meaning.

This release preserves each entry in both Japanese and English, as individual markdown files, numbered and dated, with a unified index.

## Theme and Approach

The notes in this series are not theoretical papers or language lessons, but compact and accessible meditations on the structure and flow of Japanese. Some focus on colloquial immediacy, others on classical literary phrasing. Across all, the goal is to explore how meaning arises not only from what is said, but also from what is left unsaid—through glosses, ellipses, and structures that resist full translation.

This project also lays the groundwork for describing Japanese with a modular and extensible approach to glossing, incorporating immediate grammar and poetic function.
