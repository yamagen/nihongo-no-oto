## AI Does Not Replace Human Analysis

### Summary

Using AI to organize and prepare materials can be a great help in humanities research. However, when analysis and interpretation are left entirely to AI, it
becomes harder to see where the real focus of the research lies. This note reflects on how AI can be used not as a partner that "thinks for us," but as a
"supporting hand" that helps us think more deeply.

### Main Text

As AI becomes a familiar topic, we often hear the phrase "analyzing with AI." But in actual research settings, AI often plays a more supportive role — helping
us clean, structure, and prepare our materials rather than drawing conclusions for us.

In classical studies, for instance, much of the work involves transcription, annotation, and text organization. When AI helps with those tasks, researchers can
focus more on what only humans can perceive — the flow of words, the movement of feeling, the quiet rhythm of language itself. AI does not think in our place;
it quietly supports the foundation on which research stands.

At the same time, when analysis is handed over to AI, we sometimes lose sight of the "why" behind the results. What AI provides is not understanding, but a
statistical arrangement of what seems most likely. Because of that, interpretation still requires the human sense — intuition, context, and experience that
numbers alone cannot hold.

Perhaps the balance lies here: use AI to prepare and shape the data, and then use your own eyes and ears to rediscover what the words mean and how people felt.
That shared effort might be just right for the humanities in the age of AI.

AI is not a substitute for human thinking. Rather, it lends a hand so that we can think more deeply, in our own way.
