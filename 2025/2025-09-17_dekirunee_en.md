### Summary

Inspired by the AEAD entry on "dekiru nee," this essay examines the fact that communication can succeed even without full sentences. Through this expression, which conveys emotion, immediacy, and evaluation, we consider the meaning and role of "unsaid words" in language use.

### Main Text
Even if someone only says "dekiru nee" ("you're good at it"), conversation can still succeed.  
To construct a sentence, subjects, objects, and verbs are not always necessary.  
If we assume that language requires every syntactic element to be overtly expressed, then such utterances would not count as language.  

Yet in reality, the listener understands something like "You can do that, right?" or "You're capable of it."  
In other words, **communication succeeds because the listener supplements what is left unsaid**.  
This is not so much an "ellipsis" as it is simply "left unsaid" because it is obvious from context.  

The issue is how to position this reality of "not saying" within linguistic theory.  
‚ñºOne approach, as in generative grammar, assumes universal underlying rules and treats the unspoken parts as structurally present.  
‚ñºAnother approach focuses on how language is actually used‚Äîwhat is left unspoken in conversation and how listeners infer it.  

This relationship between **what is left unsaid and how it is inferred** is a central theme in linguistics.  
Especially in conversation, the listener‚Äôs inferential ability plays a crucial role.  
Moreover, in some languages and cultures, **commenting immediately on another‚Äôs action or ability, as in 'dekiru nee,' is central to conversation**.  
This shows that language does not always require complete sentences; in immediate reactions, the "unsaid" itself functions as a rule.

## üîç Typological Perspectives

1. **Evaluation-centered type**

   * Conversation is based on evaluative words like "you can do it," "great," "nice."
   * Everyday talk largely consists of "observation + evaluation."
   * Seen, for example, in some languages of Papua New Guinea and other small-scale communities.

2. **Immediate-reaction type**

   * Short responses to another‚Äôs action serve as conversational lubricants.
   * Similar to Japanese "a, sou" ("oh, I see"), "hee" ("wow"), or "dekiru nee."
   * Found in many oral cultures of the Pacific Islands and Southeast Asia.

3. **Praise-centered type**

   * It is socially expected to immediately respond with "well done!" or "that‚Äôs great!" to children or peers.
   * More a cultural norm than a strictly linguistic one, but it becomes a habitual linguistic practice.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

* Non-sentence forms play an essential role in communication and function as part of language.  
* The relationship between "not saying" and "listener supplementation" is a key theme in linguistics.  
* In immediate reactions, "not saying" itself must be described as a rule.
