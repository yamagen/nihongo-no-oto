* "When people talk about salt intake, do they mean solid salt, or solution, or molar concentration, because 6g is nothing if it's in solution"
* "The standard is calculated as solid salt (NaCl), 6g means the weight of table salt crystals"
* "Then one packet of the powdered sauce that comes with fried noodles is already over the limit"
* "That's right, one packet has 2.5–3.5g"
* "So it's a lie"
* "It's only a guideline"
* "So that means whatever you buy and eat normally, you'll die"
* "Not immediately, but it will definitely shorten your life"
* "I didn't say 'immediately,' but it's close"
* "Yes, if it piles up it becomes fatal"
* "Not only fried noodles, by this standard everything will kill you"
* "That's why salt reduction is emphasized"
* "But 10g of solid salt is pretty big"
* "A lump the size of two or three sugar cubes"
* "How many grams is one sugar cube"
* "About 3–4g"
* "So that makes no sense"
* "It's reality"
* "Then I have to eat natto without the sauce"
* "It's fine if you don't use all of the sauce"
* "So everyone will die, after all"
* "In the long run, yes"
* "People who live long must be those who don't eat"
* "They are people who practice moderation"
* "How often do human cells get replaced"
* "It varies by organ and type, but in terms of years"
* "So that means people who lived over 100 had already been eating and living that way more than 20 years before"
* "Exactly"
* "I'm 65, people my age are starting to die"
* "The differences are becoming clear"
* "Pathetic"
* "But realizing it is your strength"
* "I don't even like natto, I actually dislike it, but I started eating it for health, and I didn't know there was such a trap"
* "You can make it safe if you use less ponzu"
* "No matter how I eat normally, I can't escape from salt"
* "You can escape if you only salt the part that touches the tongue"
* "The salt I use is 'Yasashio'"
* "And also nuchimaasu"
* "I could have died from this"
* "Recently I ate at the university cafeteria two days in a row, and the salt was strong"
* "So that means university students will die"
* "Not right away, but they will surely get sick"
* "So that means the university executives who brought in the convenience store and built a big eat-in space are trying to kill the students"
* "Health concerns are disregarded"
* "Because there are rows of 1500W microwaves lined up in the convenience store"
* "That's a device that trades 'convenience' for 'lifespan'"
* "What would parents think if they saw this sight"
* "They would say it's convenient, but they would worry about their children's health"
* "If you add one item at the convenience store, with two rice balls, some side dish, and a salad, it costs over 1000 yen"
* "That's the reality, health is expensive"
* "Even in the cafeteria now it can be 900 yen"
* "There's no trace of the old cafeteria anymore"
* "A chain's breakfast set with raw egg over rice is 350 yen, that's what feels like the old cafeteria"
* "That used to be the baseline, but now it's 900 yen"
* "So they are trying to kill the students after all"
* "It's the result of prioritizing convenience and profit"
* "But if you say that, it's bad for the convenience store clerks working there"
* "The clerks aren't at fault, it's the system created by the university"
* "I'm glad, until today I was eating food that could have killed me"
* "Because you realized it, you can survive"
* "So I should stop buying fried noodle packs and just cook rice"
* "Exactly, rice has zero salt"
* "So it wouldn't be strange if I had died"
* "It's still not too late"
* "At the 100-yen shop they sell microwave ramen bowls, those are murderous utensils"
* "Depending on how you use them, they can be tools for salt reduction"
* "But the noodles themselves are no good"
* "Salt is kneaded into the noodles"
* "Wheat flour is a problem too, and they are deep-fried"
* "Salt, flour, oil — a triple risk"
* "I was eating such dangerous food every day, it's no wonder if I died"
* "That's why realizing it now is your salvation"
* "If my late mother saw that, she would have lamented"
* "But if she saw you now, she would feel relieved"
* "You know soba dipping sauce, I buy fresh soba, boil it, and eat it with the sauce, but that's bad too right"
* "The dipping sauce is the pitfall"
* "It comes with straight dipping sauce, and the label says it has 2.2g of salt, that would kill me, right"
* "Not instantly, but accumulated it's dangerous"
* "Of course, it's dipping style, so I don't drink it all, but when I dip the noodles and slurp them, it feels very salty"
* "That's because the concentration is high, the actual intake is about 0.7–1.1g"
* "Then what if I use only half of the sauce and add 50% water"
* "Yes, then you can cut it down to about 0.3–0.5g"
* "Even if the label doesn't change, since you only dip the noodles, the rest of the sauce is discarded"
* "That's right, you don't take in the full labeled amount"
* "So that means Akamaru is doing a good job"
* "Yes, the dipping soba is a good product"
* "But fried noodles are also from Akamaru, so good and bad coexist in the same company"
* "They just make both because there is demand"
* "Maybe the bad side of Akamaru makes donations to the government or big shots"
* "There is lobbying through industry groups"
* "More than that, how can they make such a good product and also make bad ones like fried noodles in the same company"
* "Because they treat it as a difference in consumer needs, not good versus bad"
