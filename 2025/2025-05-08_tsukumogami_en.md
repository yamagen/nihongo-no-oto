### Summary

In one episode of the _Ise Monogatari_, a single line—"Thus and thus, I think"—sets everything in motion. Without poetry, without elaboration, a nameless third son silently orchestrates an encounter between his mother and the narrator, Ariwara no Narihira. What follows is a delicate play of embarrassment, misreading, and poetic cover-up. This entry explores how silence, misdirection, and minimal language function as narrative force—and how Narihira, caught in the act of being duped, redeems himself through poetic performance.

### Main Text

"Thus and thus, I think."

That's all he says. No mention of his mother, no detail about her looks or age, not even a subject. Just that one line.

And it works.

The third son approaches Narihira—out on a hunt—and delivers this cryptic message. Narihira fills in the gaps himself: surely a beautiful young woman has sent this boy. Flattered and intrigued, he goes with him, visits the house, and spends the night.

The boy says nothing more. He doesn’t explain. He doesn’t overplay his hand. He simply lets Narihira imagine the rest.

This is the brilliance of the third son’s strategy: he relies on implication, expectation, and silence. And Narihira, as narrator, captures it all with that one brief utterance: _kaukau namu omou_—"Thus and thus, I think." In that line, the boy’s intelligence is preserved with striking economy.

But the story doesn’t end there.

The next day, Narihira composes a poem mocking the situation:

> "An old woman thinking of me—what a joke."

Unluckily—or perhaps inevitably—the woman hears it. And she answers, not directly, but from inside the house, in a voice she knows he will hear:

> "Nights without you are lonely."

It’s not just a response. It’s a performance.

She knows she’s older. She knows Narihira is outside, listening. And so she plays the part—not of a seductress, but of a woman earnestly longing for someone she believes she has touched.

Faced with this, Narihira has only one move left: poetic justification. He concludes the tale with the now-famous line:

> "This man could love a beauty or a woman with gray hair all the same."

Is it true? Maybe. But more likely, it’s a **cover story**—a graceful way to save face after being cleverly outplayed.

And that’s what makes this episode more than a comic episode or a love anecdote. It’s a drama of implication: of things not said, of social performance, of misread signals and poetic recovery. It’s _Ise Monogatari_ at its most compact and its most brilliant.
