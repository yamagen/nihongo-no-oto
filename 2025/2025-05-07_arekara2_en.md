### Summary

The English sentence "What happened after that, yesterday?" has a clear syntactic structure and can be diagrammed using phrase structure grammar. In contrast, the Japanese utterance 「ねえ、きのう、あれから、どうした」 relies heavily on shared context and the natural flow of conversation, making it difficult to represent in a syntactic tree. This comparison highlights the fundamental difference between immediate grammar and syntax-driven grammar.

### Main Text

"What happened after that, yesterday?" — this English sentence consists of distinct grammatical components: the subject ("What"), the verb ("happened"), and temporal adverbial phrases ("after that," "yesterday"). It represents a typical WH-question structure and can be analyzed as S → Aux + V + Adv.

In fact, a syntactic tree can be drawn for it:

```
CP
├── WH-phrase: What
├── C'
│   ├── C: [did] (null or auxiliary movement placeholder)
│   └── TP
│       ├── T'
│       │   ├── T: [past]
│       │   └── VP
│       │       ├── V: happen
│       │       └── PP: after that
│       └── AdvP: yesterday
```

Now, let's look at the corresponding Japanese expression: 「ねえ、きのう、あれから、どうした」.

This Japanese utterance lacks an explicit subject or grammatical particles. It simply consists of adverbial expressions like "kinō" (yesterday), "are kara" (after that), followed by the question "dō shita" (what happened). Yet, in conversation, it makes perfect sense. Pragmatically speaking, it is complete and meaningful, but there is insufficient syntactic information to produce a tree diagram.

Whereas English is a **syntax-driven language**, Japanese functions more as a **context- and relation-driven language**. In short:

- In English: syntax comes first; meaning follows.
- In Japanese: meaning arises first; syntax follows (if needed).

This contrast draws our attention to the unique power of **immediate grammar** in Japanese. The sentence 「ねえ、きのう、あれから、どうした」 becomes a fully valid act of communication through shared context and interpersonal dynamics, without requiring grammatical completion. This is a prime example of "the telling begins before it is told."
