# **Common Misunderstandings and How to Avoid Them: Correctly Positioning the Process Grammar Model**

Last updated: 2025/11/27-22:10:00

## **Summary**

The Process Grammar Model is often misunderstood at first glance as a new label imposed on existing theories. This misunderstanding arises because PGM introduces distinctions and perspectives that traditional grammatical theories have not treated as central analytical units. This article analyzes why PGM tends to be misunderstood and offers strategies for presenting the theory in a way that prevents such misinterpretations.

# **Main Text**

Although the Process Grammar Model introduces perspectives not found in existing linguistic theories, this very innovation can lead to misunderstandings. In particular, the distinction between Immediate Grammar and Adjustive Grammar may appear, on the surface, as if it were simply a newly invented set of terms. However, these misunderstandings do not stem from the theory itself. They arise because several underlying assumptions are often left unstated when PGM is introduced.

First, PGM redefines grammar as a process rather than a system. This conception differs from the analytic scope of most established frameworks. When placed in contrast with system-oriented descriptions of grammar, the same term may seem to refer to a different concept. For this reason, it is essential to explicitly state that PGM involves a redefinition of the notion of grammar from a static structure to a time-based process.

Second, the phenomena addressed by Immediate Grammar have rarely been treated as data in traditional linguistic analysis because they are overly familiar and embedded in everyday behavior. Human reactions, breath patterns, and moment-to-moment adjustments are experiences shared by all speakers, and for this reason they are often taken for granted. As a result, the theory may appear to be a renaming of obvious phenomena. To avoid this, one must present concrete data that demonstrate the systematic nature of these immediate reactions.

Third, PGM has a broad descriptive range that extends across modern Japanese, classical Japanese, and spoken interaction. This breadth can create the impression that PGM is an extended form of an existing theory rather than a new observational method grounded in linguistic behavior. Clarifying the scope and purpose of the model helps prevent this misunderstanding.

Avoiding these misunderstandings requires careful control of explanatory order. Instead of introducing terminology first, one should begin with the observable phenomena. Once the data are presented, terminology can be introduced as a necessary distinction for describing those phenomena. In other words, explaining the terms through the data, rather than explaining the data through the terms, makes it clear that the terminology is not arbitrary but derived from empirical observation.

Furthermore, grounding Immediate Grammar and Adjustive Grammar in psychological reality strengthens their scientific legitimacy. Differences in processing speed, cognitive load, and timing can be linked to research in speech production and cognitive psychology. Such connections emphasize that PGM is not a terminological invention but a method for describing linguistic behavior in time.
