### Summary

During the glossing work for *Ise Monogatari*, the question arose of how to represent the gloss for "te." While "te" can be interpreted in many ways, grammatically it is simply a device for connecting elements, and the assignment of specific relations between them is left to human cognition. This note clarifies that nature and records the glossing policy.

### Main Text

"Te" is a versatile word.  
It can indicate reason, sequential connection, temporal relations, or even mild parallelism or supplementary information. However, all these diverse interpretations are the result of the speaker or listener inferring meaning from context.

From a grammatical perspective, "te" is simply a conjunctive particle.  
Its role is clear: to connect the preceding element with the following one. Adding meanings such as "therefore," "and," or "then" is the work of human thought, not an inherent part of linguistic structure.

This point is crucial in literal translation and glossing.  
If we write in the specific relationship during glossing, we risk mixing grammatical description with pragmatic interpretation. Therefore, in this project, "te" is always glossed as `CONJ` (conjunction), and its specific relational meaning is not included in the gloss.

This policy is fully consistent with the perspective of Immediate Grammar. Immediate Grammar prioritizes structural operation over interpretive meaning. When forming sentences, people use "te" to connect elements, and only afterwards assign meaning according to the context and situation. Therefore, at the descriptive stage, it is sufficient to record the minimal function of "linking."

"Te" also has some particularly interesting characteristics.  
Like "and" or "then" in English, it can serve as a conjunction, but it attaches to verbs and implies that something will follow. Often there is nothing inserted between the verb and "te":  
Examples include "itte" (go-TE), "kite" (come-TE), "tabete" (eat-TE).  
It is common for nothing to appear between the verb and "te," but that does not mean nothing can ever occur.

For example:

1. "mite ite, kidzuita n da kedo" – "watch-TE be-TE, I noticed"  
2. "katte oite, son wa nai" – "buy-TE put-TE, it won't be a loss"  
3. "itte mite, dou datta?" – "go-TE try-TE, how was it?"  
4. "yatte shimatte, koukai shite iru" – "do-TE finish-TE, I regret it"

In such cases, elements like "te iru" indicating aspect can follow.  
However, tense markers never occur between the verb and "te"; tense is usually expressed by what follows "te." The phrase "usually expressed" is important here, because sometimes after "te" there is just mumbling or a pause with nothing explicitly said. This **deliberate omission** strategy allows "te" to suggest either past or future events, making it a convenient device.

In the end, "te" is a linking tool, and the meaning of what it links is created by the speaker or listener.  
Therefore, in glossing, it is recorded simply as `CONJ`.
