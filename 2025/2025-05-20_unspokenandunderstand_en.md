# Unspoken elements: "What Is Unspoken Can Still Be Understood"

### Summary

There is meaning in what is left unsaid—this proposition is not limited to the realm of literary interpretation, but is a recurring theme in philosophy and the use of everyday language. This essay explores how the phenomenon of "understanding what is not said" emerges at the intersection of literary experience and philosophical intuition, and considers how it can be preserved in practices such as translation, annotation, and interpretation.

### Main Text

When a word is not spoken, it does not simply vanish into silence—it often sharpens the contours of the words that remain. In classical Japanese poetry, ellipsis, inversion, and pauses are not omissions but devices that direct the reader's sensitivity toward what is unspoken.

In translation and annotation, handling this "unspoken" dimension is not just a technical challenge but an ethical one. It is easy to fill in the gaps with explanations such as "why this was left unsaid," but it is a far more demanding choice to deliberately leave the silence intact, entrusting that interpretive space to the reader.

At first glance, this choice may appear relativistic. However, I see it rather as a statement of trust in the potential for shared understanding.

That which remains unsaid can still be understood—even by readers from different cultural backgrounds—not simply because they possess enough contextual knowledge, but because they are willing to imagine, prepared to interpret, and mature enough to accept ambiguity. Only through such engagement can silence rise to the level of meaning.

When Wittgenstein wrote, “Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent,” he was not denying the inexpressible, but suggesting the vastness of what can be contained in that which is deliberately left unsaid.

Our work in glossing and translation, too, should not aim to say everything. Rather, by describing structures in which silence remains, we can begin to document what I call "intelligible silence."
