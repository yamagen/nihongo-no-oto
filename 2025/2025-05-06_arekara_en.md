### Summary

"Hey, yesterday—after that, what happened?" is an incomplete sentence lacking a subject or clear grammatical particles, and yet it immediately makes sense in conversation. Though structurally fragmentary, it is pragmatically complete—sustained by shared context and interpersonal relation. It serves as a quintessential example of immediate grammar, where the utterance begins even before it is fully spoken.

### Main Text

"Hey, yesterday—after that, what happened?"

Is this a sentence, or merely an utterance?

Even though it is written down and intelligible to the reader, this expression defies syntactic analysis using traditional phrase structure grammar. There is no subject, no clear syntactic object, and even the word order is fluid. And yet, in spoken interaction, it makes perfect sense.

This is because the utterance is not syntactically complete but **pragmatically** complete. Phrases like “yesterday” and “after that” serve to evoke a shared past experience between the speaker and listener. “What happened?” functions as a follow-up anchored in this common understanding.

From a grammatical point of view, such a sentence might appear incomplete. But within the flow of conversation, it is already complete—because the storytelling has already begun. This is exactly what is meant by “the telling begins before it is told.”

The fact that one cannot build a tree diagram for this sentence doesn’t mean it is grammatically defective. Rather, it means that such utterances fall outside the scope of traditional syntactic models. In reality, it achieves communicative completeness through a three-layered structure: a call to attention, shared memory, and a prompting question.

While traditional syntactic frameworks struggle to describe such expressions, **immediate grammar** recognizes them as naturally occurring and functional.

Moreover, expressions like this are not limited to spoken language. They can stand on their own as written language as well. Such utterances grounded in immediate grammar hold important implications for Japanese language education, pragmatics, and descriptive linguistics.
