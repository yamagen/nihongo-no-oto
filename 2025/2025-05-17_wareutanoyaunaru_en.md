### Introduction: When unsaid words emerge in the act of narration

The line from the _Tosa Nikki_ (Tosa Diary), "Kajitori wa utsutae ni ware uta no you naru koto iu to nimo arazu" contains a remarkable narrative mechanism. Here, the narrator momentarily performs the role of Kajitori, making it sound as though Kajitori had said something like "I just uttered something poetic, didn't I?", only to immediately negate it: "...not that he actually said such a thing."

This structure is deeply familiar in contemporary Japanese, as in: "...I might’ve said something like that or whatever, y’know? Well, not that I actually did." This essay refers to such constructions as _pseudo-quotation_ and aims to analyze them through the lens of _Immediate Grammar_.

### Improvised quotations that emerge within solo narration

> Kajitori wa utsutae ni ware uta no you naru koto iu to nimo arazu.

In this sentence, the phrase "ware uta no you naru koto iu" (I say something like a poem) is not something Kajitori actually said. Yet the narrator adopts his voice, performing what Kajitori might have said, only to follow it with a denial: "to nimo arazu" — "he didn't even say that."

At this moment, the narrator transforms into Kajitori. A quote-like expression emerges, but it only exists within the act of narration and vanishes just as quickly. **The narrator’s voice and the character’s voice briefly intersect and shift in real time.**

### A familiar pattern in modern Japanese

> "So, like, I kinda said something all poetic or whatever, y’know\... well, not that I actually said it."

This kind of speech is very common in casual Japanese. Key features include:

- Words not actually spoken are performed as if they were
- There are no markers like quotation particles (e.g., "to") or quotation marks
- The utterance takes the form of a quote but is hedged or denied afterward

In such narration, **the speaker borrows the voice of another (or a past version of themselves), briefly performs it, and then releases it**.

### Why this is Immediate Grammar

This structure is classified as Immediate Grammar for three primary reasons:

1. **Unprepared improvisation**: The narrator introduces an utterance without prior syntactic setup.
2. **Role-switching**: The narrator temporarily becomes the character, speaking in their voice.
3. **Reversibility of speech**: The pseudo-quotation is denied or retracted immediately after it appears.

In this sense, it perfectly embodies Immediate Grammar’s key features: "perform → revert," "speak → deny."

### How traditional grammar has treated this: Or rather, hasn't

Within structuralist and generative grammar, such constructions have rarely been addressed directly.

Traditional grammar typically assumes:

- Quotations are introduced with particles like "to" or quotation marks
- Sentences follow fixed structures like "Subject + Verb + to + Quotation"
- Reported speech reflects actual speech events and is structurally demarcated

Therefore, such constructions do not fit neatly into conventional analysis:

- The quotation appears without quotation markers
- The utterance is denied mid-sentence
- Intent and factuality are misaligned, and meaning relies on the listener’s real-time inference

Phrase structure grammar presumes a fully formed syntactic tree. Structures where speaker roles change mid-utterance, or where quotations are denied before closing, destabilize the tree and are hard to represent.

As a result, _pseudo-quotation_ is often treated as an error or relegated to the margins of discourse or pragmatics — not syntax.

### Why Immediate Grammar is needed

_Immediate Grammar_ is a framework that captures how speakers construct utterances dynamically, allowing for improvisation, reversals, and embedded performance.

This framework is necessary because:

1. **Syntax emerges during speech**: Sentences are not pre-formed; meaning unfolds as the speaker speaks, and the listener constructs understanding on the fly.
2. **Performative utterances temporarily violate structure**: The quotation may begin but never finish, or subjects shift within embedded roles.
3. **Syntax and pragmatics are inseparable**: The speaker’s momentary voice-switching and gesture-based storytelling directly influence sentence structure.

_Immediate Grammar_ accounts for this dynamic generation of structure and meaning, unlike traditional static tree-based models.

### Theatricality in narration and structural misalignment

The _pseudo-quotation_ structure is not merely syntactic — it is also physical and performative. The narrator enacts the role of the character while withholding responsibility for the words.

Like a rakugo performer (traditional Japanese solo storyteller), the narrator shifts voice: "Yeah, so I said something all poetic and stuff... not that I actually said it." This performance allows for structural irregularities and gives the listener a vivid sense of presence.

### Conclusion: Unspeakable speech, and the voices within narration

When someone says, "...not that I actually said it," they’re borrowing a voice, giving shape to an unresolved feeling or thought through a fictional utterance.

The _Tosa Nikki_ shows that such structures are not modern inventions, but deeply embedded in Japanese narrative tradition.

The narrator borrows a voice, speaks through it, and returns. In this breath of improvisation lives the softness and depth of Japanese narrative speech.
