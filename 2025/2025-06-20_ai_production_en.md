### Summary

Since the advancement of generative AI after 2023, we have entered an era in
which the very act of writing is met with suspicion. Especially when researchers
or thinkers who had previously published little suddenly begin producing a
variety of work, there arises a risk—regardless of the quality of the
content—that others assume AI has done the thinking. This essay records my own
stance on the relationship between writing with AI and human thought.

### Main Text

Suppose someone who had not written much before suddenly begins publishing
actively. What if this sudden output coincides with the rise of AI technologies?
Society is likely to assume, "AI must have written it."

But the truth is often different.

The thoughts, questions, and half-formed hypotheses were there all along. What
was missing was simply the opportunity—or the right trigger—to express them in
language. The interaction with AI became that very trigger.

AI helps organize concepts. It connects fragmented pieces. It responds to
questions instantly. Rather than being a co-author, AI is closer to a **catalyst
for thought**.

What AI gave me was the courage to start writing.

### Regaining a Rhythm of Writing and Facing Misunderstanding

Still, I understand this too:

Society does not trust people who suddenly begin to write. Or more precisely, it
doesn’t believe that the person wrote it alone.

So how can we address this misunderstanding?

- Keep records of the thinking and generation process
- Make traces of dialogue and drafts visible
- Maintain the rhythm of one’s own voice and storytelling
- Explicitly state: "I use AI, but these are my thoughts."

Continuing to document one’s own stance in this way may be essential in the long
run.
