### Summary

Are humans essentially fond of talking?  
Even after years working in linguistics and language education, I still don’t have a clear answer to this question.  
Looking back on my childhood habit of raising my hand in class even when I had no idea what was being asked, I am reminded that the essence of language may not
lie in transmitting information, but in maintaining relationships.

Drawing on Malinowski’s notion of _phatic communion_, Jakobson’s _phatic function_, and Goffman’s theory of _face-work_, I reflect on the idea that learning
language is not about academic performance or scholarship, but about the ongoing work of relating to others.

### Main Text

I have worked in linguistics and language education for a long time, but even now I still don’t have a clear answer to whether humans are fundamentally fond of
talking.

When I was a schoolchild, there were always one or two students in the classroom who would deliberately steer the lesson off-topic.  
I wasn’t that kind of child.  
I was the kind of child who would raise my hand even when I didn’t understand anything.  
It wasn’t because I was particularly earnest.  
When the teacher asked, “Who knows this?”, I would raise my hand even though I didn’t know.  
If nobody raised their hand, I wouldn’t either, but if a few did, I would join in, lifting my hand as well.  
When the teacher looked like they might call on me, or when our eyes met, I would quickly lower my hand.  
And if I was actually called on, I would say, “I misunderstood the question.”  
I would raise my hand even though I never knew the answer.  
From the start, I never even considered what the problem was, much less what the answer might be.  
I would raise my hand even though I didn’t know.  
That’s the kind of child I was.

It wasn’t out of any sense of responsibility or a taste for risk.  
I simply enjoyed pretending to be deep in thought.  
I had to be careful that the teacher didn’t realize I wasn’t thinking about the problem—and, of course, that my classmates didn’t realize it either.  
I always had to keep a serious expression.  
I had to maintain the appearance of thinking sincerely.  
If I smiled even a little or let it show that I was doing it on purpose, that was a complete failure.  
Since my focus was on doing that properly, it was inevitable my grades weren’t good.  
But in the classroom, I was always fully absorbed.  
Of course, I was serious about something entirely unrelated to the lesson itself.

On my report cards, teachers sometimes wrote, “Always shows a serious attitude toward learning.”  
For some reason, I found it enjoyable, and I went to school every day.

This experience became, in a small way, the starting point for seeing the essence of language not in the transmission of information, but in the adjustment and
performance of relationships.

The Polish anthropologist Malinowski, in _The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages_ (1923), proposed the idea of _phatic communion_, emphasizing that
greetings and trivial exchanges play an essential role in sustaining relationships.

> "There is clearly another function of language which is neither the expression of thought, nor the expression of emotions, but a function serving to establish
> bonds of union between people."  
> (_The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages_, 1923, p.315)

Roman Jakobson, in his 1960 “Closing Statement: Linguistics and Poetics,” classified six functions of language, including the _phatic function_.

> Communication serves to establish, prolong, or discontinue communication, to check whether the channel works (“Hello, do you hear me?”), to attract the
> attention of the interlocutor or to confirm continued attention (“Are you listening?” or “Uh-huh”).  
> (_Closing Statement_, 1960)

Erving Goffman, in _Interaction Ritual_, pointed out that all our speech is an endless effort to maintain face.

> "Face-work serves to counteract 'incidents'—events whose effective symbolic implications threaten face."  
> (_Interaction Ritual_, 1967)

Taken together, these perspectives suggest that learning language is not merely about mastering techniques of transmitting information.  
Rather, it is a way of continually reconstructing one’s relationships with others and showing how one is present among them.

“Language exists not for human beings themselves, but for relationships.”  
This proposition reminds me of another face of language—one that has nothing to do with grades or scholarship.
