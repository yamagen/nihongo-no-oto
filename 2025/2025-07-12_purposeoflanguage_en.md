### Summary

Are humans inherently fond of talking?  
I have worked in linguistics and language education for many years, yet I still do not have a clear answer to this question.  
Looking back on my childhood memories of repeatedly raising my hand in class even when I had no idea what was being asked, I am reminded that the essence of
language lies not in transmitting information but in maintaining relationships.

Drawing on Malinowski's notion of _phatic communion_, Jakobson's idea of the _phatic function_, and Goffman's concept of _face-work_, I revisit the view that
the purpose of language learning is not academic achievement or scholarship, but rather an ongoing practice of relating to others.

### Main Text

I have been involved in linguistics and language education for a long time, but I still do not have a clear answer to the question of whether humans are
fundamentally inclined to talk.

When I was in elementary school, there was always one or two children in the classroom who would deliberately derail the lesson with playful remarks, but I was
not that kind of child.  
I was the kind of child who raised my hand even when I didn’t understand the question.  
It wasn’t because I was particularly earnest about the lessons. When the teacher would say, “Who knows the answer?” I would raise my hand without knowing at
all.  
If no one raised their hand, I would also stay still, but once a few classmates raised theirs, I would quietly join in.  
And when the teacher looked as though they were about to call on me, or when our eyes met, I would quickly put my hand down.  
If I did get called on, I would say, “I misunderstood the question.”  
I would raise my hand even when I truly had no idea.  
From the beginning, I was not thinking about what the problem was, nor did I know the answer.  
I would raise my hand without knowing.  
That was the kind of child I was.  
It was essential that neither the teacher nor my classmates noticed that I was not thinking about the question.  
I always had to keep a serious face.  
I had to maintain the appearance of being deeply engaged.  
If I even slightly smiled or betrayed that it was an act, that would have been a complete failure.  
Since I was so focused on that performance, there was no way my grades could be good.  
But in class, I was always fully concentrated.  
Of course, I was serious about something entirely different from the actual lesson.

On my report cards, the teachers would write, "He always shows a serious attitude toward his work." For some reason, I enjoyed that, and I went to school every
day.

This experience became a small starting point for a perspective that sees the essence of language not in "information transmission," but rather in the
adjustment and performance of relationships.

The Polish anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski argued in 1923 that language has a role beyond expressing thought or emotion: it creates bonds between people.  
He called this _phatic communion_ and suggested that even seemingly empty greetings or back-channel responses play an important role in sustaining
relationships. (Malinowski 1923)

Roman Jakobson, in 1960, categorized the various functions of language and identified among them what he called the _phatic function_.  
This refers to utterances that start, maintain, or close communication—phrases like "Hello," "Can you hear me?" or "Uh-huh."(Jakobson 1960)

Erving Goffman, in 1967, pointed out that whenever we speak, we are constantly performing to maintain our face and social standing.  
Conversation, he suggested, is not merely the exchange of information but also a ritual in which we safeguard our own face in front of others.(Goffman 1967)

Taken together, these perspectives suggest that learning a language is not simply acquiring techniques for conveying information.  
Rather, it is a practice of continually renegotiating our connections to others and showing how we belong there.

"Language exists not for the individual, but for relationships."  
This idea reminds me of another side of language that has nothing to do with grades or academic knowledge.
