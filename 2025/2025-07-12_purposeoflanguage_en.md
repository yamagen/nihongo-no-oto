### Summary

Are humans inherently fond of speaking?  
After many years in linguistics and language education, I still do not have a clear answer to this question.  
Reflecting on my childhood habit of pretending to think deeply in the classroom, I return to the perspective that language is less about transmitting
information and more about maintaining relationships.

Drawing on Malinowski's notion of phatic communion, Jakobson's phatic function, and Goffman’s face-work, this essay revisits the idea that the purpose of
learning language is neither academic achievement nor scholarship, but rather the ongoing work of relationship-building.

### Main Text

I have spent much of my life in linguistics and language education, and yet I still cannot say for certain whether humans are, by nature, fond of speaking.

At the same time, I often recall my childhood in school, when I would sit there pretending to think very hard.  
Remembering that habit makes me reflect again on the essence of language and the meaning of learning.

In elementary school, I would frown and murmur to myself, "Something's not right..." without really knowing what I was thinking about.  
Those moments were not about gathering information, achieving good grades, or pursuing scholarship.  
They were, perhaps, a kind of linguistic gesture to carve out my place among the people and the atmosphere around me.

This experience became a small starting point for my perspective that the core of language lies not in information transmission but rather in the adjustment and
performance of relationships.

The Polish anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, in his 1923 essay _The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages_, introduced the concept of **phatic
communion**, arguing that superficially empty greetings and responses play an essential role in sustaining social bonds.

> "There is clearly another function of language which is neither the expression of thought, nor the expression of emotions, but a function serving to establish
> bonds of union between people."  
> (_The Problem of Meaning in Primitive Languages_, 1923, p.315)

Roman Jakobson, in his 1960 essay _Closing Statement: Linguistics and Poetics_, organized six functions of language and emphasized the **phatic function** among
them.

> Communication serves to establish, prolong, or discontinue communication, to check whether the channel works ("Hello, do you hear me?"), to attract the
> attention of the interlocutor or to confirm continued attention ("Are you listening?" or "Uh-huh").  
> (_Closing Statement_, 1960)

Erving Goffman, in _Interaction Ritual_, pointed out that our linguistic acts are an unending performance to preserve our face in front of others.

> "Face-work serves to counteract 'incidents' — events whose effective symbolic implications threaten face."  
> (_Interaction Ritual_, 1967)

Taken together, these perspectives suggest that learning language is not merely a skill for transmitting information.  
Rather, it is a technique for continually reweaving relationships and showing how we choose to be present among others.

**Language exists not for humans themselves, but for relationships.**  
This idea reminds me that there is another side to language—one that goes beyond grades, academic success, or knowledge itself.
