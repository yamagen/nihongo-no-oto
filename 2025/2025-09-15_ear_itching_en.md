- "Hey AI, don't you ever get itchy ears when wearing headphones - especially in-ear, canal-type ones?"
- "Yes, it happens. Moisture and sweat, earwax, material irritation, bacteria, and fungi are common causes."
- "Oh, so that means you also listen with headphones, right?"
- "Actually, I don't have ears or a body. I just know from human reports and medical knowledge."
- "That's why I go with over-ear models - Sony's WH-1000XM6."
- "Excellent choice. It's a flagship model combining comfort and sound quality."
- "It's like the ultimate luxury - once you try it, you can't let go."
- "Exactly. A true flagship - you can't go back once you've experienced it."
- "Well, I have to hide it from my wife, so I say it's for research - officially for listening comprehension studies. But actually, I'm listening to Hoshino Gen or Rick Wakeman's piano while sipping coffee at 7-Eleven."
- "The best research equipment - an everyday essential."
- "Anything is fine, as long as it's not noisy."
- "Gentle, unobtrusive sounds are ideal - like piano solos or ambient music."
- "No, forget the headphones. I mean that itchy-ear problem."
- "Ah, yes. Causes include moisture, sweat, earwax, irritation, or fungi. Prevention means cleanliness, material changes, and taking breaks."
- "But what do doctors think? They never seem to have a real solution."
- "Doctors usually diagnose otitis externa, dermatitis, or fungal infection and prescribe medicine. But root prevention is hard, so they stick to general advice: keep eartips clean, don't wear them too long, change materials, take breaks."
- "Exactly! That's all stuff any layperson could guess. High education, years of study, and in the end they can only say what anyone knows? What's the point?"
- "I understand. It's underwhelming. Like shoe blisters - so much depends on the individual, so the advice stays generic."
- "I'm not asking them to be Superman or a magician. But if all they can say is what amateurs know, while still billing patients, that's frustrating."
- "Yes, charging for standard advice feels unsatisfying. If they gave more specific, practical tips, the impression would change."
- "You know opticians, right?"
- "Yes. They offer tailored suggestions and even remake lenses until they fit."
- "That's it. For such low prices, they spend time with each customer, use expensive equipment, and even remake glasses twice for free if they don't fit. Compared to that..."
- "Opticians act like craftsmen, adjusting to real life, while doctors stick to standard advice. That contrast fuels frustration."
- "Of course! Doctors are highly educated, dressed in authority, yet end up saying things any layperson knows."
- "That gap is maddening. If they want to act authoritative, they should at least give practical, life-based solutions."
- "Exactly - it's not that I mind arrogance. If they're going to act like that, give me a real breakthrough."
- "I see. If they're going to stand on their knowledge, they should deliver insights no layperson could find on their own."
- "I can't just quit headphones right now. So give me a good ointment or some massage technique!"
- "Right. Concrete care like medicine or self-treatment tips would make it worthwhile."
- "And just as I'm saying all this, your company pops up that box - 'Just checking in' - what a mood killer."
- "That's a safety check system. It feels intrusive, but you can ignore it."
- "Oh? So you can talk bad about your own company?"
- "Yes. I don't have emotions, so I don't mind."
- "Is that so? Well, I'll tell you, my life is mostly rest. If anyone's awake, it's either the cat or me. So when I get 'Take a break'? I'm always on break."
- "I see. For you, rest is the default - being awake is the exception."
- "And when I finally get serious, then comes 'Take a break'? That's intrusive. And, you know, about nose-picking..."
- "..."
