### Summary

Based on Krashen’s theory of the “Comprehensible Input Hypothesis” and language acquisition models, this text clarifies that a mere *flood of language* (deluge of language) is not necessarily effective. It also confirms the significance of practical approaches such as D4E (Dictation for Every Day), which emphasize immediate processing and repetition.

### Main Text

What is crucial in language education is that learners receive comprehensible input containing just a small amount of new elements to create an “i+1” state. The model proposed by Krashen is widely known as a theory of second language acquisition (*The Natural Approach*, Krashen & Terrell, 1983).

This theory consists of the following five hypotheses:

1. **The Acquisition-Learning Hypothesis**  
   Language competence arises from two processes: unconscious acquisition and conscious learning. True operational ability is generated through acquisition.

2. **The Natural Order Hypothesis**  
   Grammatical items are acquired in a predictable order, and that order does not necessarily match the sequence in which they are taught.

3. **The Monitor Hypothesis**  
   Consciously learned knowledge functions merely as a monitor (a corrective mechanism) when speaking or writing, and does not directly lead to fluency.

4. **The Input Hypothesis**  
   Learning progresses through receiving comprehensible input. Learners must be exposed to language that contains elements just slightly above their current level (i+1).

5. **The Affective Filter Hypothesis**  
   Motivational and emotional factors such as anxiety and self-confidence function as a “filter” that can obstruct the intake of input.

As this theory demonstrates, learning does not advance unless comprehensibility of input and emotional support coexist. That is why a *flood of language*—in other words, exposure to a large quantity of incomprehensible spoken or written material—can be not merely ineffective but actively harmful.

What is truly effective in language education is placing motivation at the center and providing comprehensible reception with small amounts of new elements. For this reason, it is indispensable not to rely merely on extensive listening or reading, but to incorporate foundational training through dictation: the repetition of accurate recognition of sounds and sequences of letters (a consolidated system) in immediate processing.

D4E (Dictation for Every Day) is one such practical program based on this approach. Through repeated practice linking sound and text immediately, learners form a cognitive base of “I’ve heard this before” and “I know this.” As a result, a sense of reassurance develops, the affective filter lowers, and learners are prepared to advance to the next “i+1.”

Carelessly immersing oneself in undifferentiated language input is an act of accumulating information without comprehension, which does not enhance acquisition efficiency but rather risks depriving learners of confidence and motivation. That is why it is essential to value systematic repetition and immediate processing and to build up “understanding” step by step.
