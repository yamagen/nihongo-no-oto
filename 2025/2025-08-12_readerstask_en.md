## Annotations That Do Not Over-Explain — Leaving Work for the Reader

### Summary

Prompted by the phrase “屠蘇白散酒加へてもて來たり” in *Tosa Nikki*, this note reflects on the role of annotation in literary works. While providing factual information through literal translation is important, it is even more crucial to leave space for the reader to reconstruct meaning for themselves — a space that lies at the heart of literary reading.

### Main Text

Language is nothing more than a set of signs. It is the author on one side and the reader on the other who attach meaning to it. The “language game” here refers, as Wittgenstein described, to the entire interactive process of language activity — not a matter of winning or losing, but an exchange of meaning within the rules and context. The author writes hoping to be understood, and the reader’s ability to respond to that is where the true enjoyment lies.

In *Tosa Nikki*, there is a passage in which the apothecary brings “屠蘇白散酒加へてもて來たり” on New Year’s Day.

*Toso* is a medicinal sake traditionally drunk at New Year, made by steeping medicinal herbs in sake or mirin. *Hakusan* is a white powdered medicine used for digestive or antipyretic purposes. Given the historical background, it was common knowledge that *toso* already contained alcohol.

A straightforward translation might be: “The apothecary, being considerate, brought *toso* and *hakusan* with added sake.” Yet Tsurayuki deliberately writes “added sake.” This emphasis must carry some intention.

Perhaps it is a light touch of humor, hinting that the apothecary himself was fond of drink. Or perhaps it reflects some ritual or custom. In any case, the author clearly wants the reader to notice something, but refrains from stating it outright, leaving it for the reader to infer.

However, conventional annotations often eliminate such ambiguity or multiplicity of meaning, collapsing interpretation into a single conclusion. By providing overly detailed background and explanations, the reader is distanced from the act of “reading” and reduced to a passive recipient of information.

The essence of literature lies in the space between author and reader. It is in this space that imagination and speculation flow. The role of annotation is not to close off this space, but to preserve it.

Cultural and historical information should be kept to the minimum necessary, and ambiguity should be intentionally left intact. In doing so, the reader can weave their own reading and feel closer to Japanese literature. This is just as true for non-native speakers — indeed, the presence of such space allows them to insert their own knowledge and experiences as they read.
