## Problem Overview

Modern natural language processing techniques—particularly meaning vector models such as word2vec and BERT—construct semantic spaces based on co-occurrence frequency and contextual dependency between words. However, applying these tools to extremely condensed poetic forms such as waka presents unique challenges. Waka does not omit meaning. Rather, meaning is inherently present, merely **not made explicit in written form**. Readers construct meaning by interpreting the relationships between words, the stance behind them, and the unspoken contexts that surround them.

## Misconceptions About Absence of Words and Meaning

The absence of a word in the text does not equate to the absence of meaning. In waka, meaning is encoded within its structural design, and an abstract semantic space unfolds behind the explicit expression.

However, modern distributional models generally assume that meaning only resides in what is textually observable. As a result, **the space of shared yet unspoken meaning** becomes inaccessible. When waka is processed using the same assumptions applied to modern language, it risks erasing the culturally, bodily, and poetically shared knowledge it presupposes.

## The Imbalance of Total Experience and Recorded Language

Large-scale corpora in modern languages attempt to comprehensively describe the full range of abstract concepts in our lives—sorrow, seasonality, affection, distance, temporality, anticipation—and convert them into semantic space. In contrast, classical texts, especially waka, explicitly represent only a fragment of those domains.

If classical language is handled using the same computational assumptions as modern language, one ends up trying to reconstruct the entire semantic field from a **partial lexical world**. In other words, it becomes **an approximation made by an incomplete cognition—what we might call a "reduced head"**—and is structurally biased from the outset.

## Descriptive Construction of Abstract Space

What is needed is not a record of whether a word physically appears in the text, but a framework that attempts to describe **the abstract semantic structures** to which that word belonged. The stance-first theory offers a hypothetical foundation for such a task.

That is, by annotating each word with its "stance" (the attitudinal orientation of its utterance) and "category" (its functional-semantic role), we may begin to approach the reconstruction of implicit meaning as a structured abstraction.

## Extracting Structural Meaning in Waka

In waka, meaning is conveyed through formal techniques such as spacing, linkage, repetition, omission, and phonological resonance. By analyzing the behavior of words through two axes—(1) what stance the word was uttered from (emotion, time, viewpoint), and (2) what kind of function it fulfills (e.g., temporal, affective, connective)—we may be able to **expand the unit of description into an abstract semantic space.**

This space is not simply based on word distribution, but rather **constituted by observed records of syntactic and pragmatic configurations** underlying word choices.

## Conclusion: Toward a Model of the Invisible

Meaning is not omitted; it is merely not explicitly stated. By re-describing the implicit structure through frameworks of stance and category—rather than relying on co-occurrence or frequency—we may be able to **explore one possible approach to modeling the abstract semantic space latent in classical language.**

This is not a matter of subjective interpretation or imaginative reconstruction. It is a matter of **observing, recording, and modeling the linguistic structure**. The "unspoken" left behind by waka may become **a target of structural reconsideration**—not through recovery, but through cumulative annotation of the stances and functions of the words that do appear.
