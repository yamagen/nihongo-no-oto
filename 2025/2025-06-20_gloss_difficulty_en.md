### Summary

Through the glossing process in the word-by-word translation project of _Ise
Monogatari_, it has become clear that glossing—such as for expressions like
"hasase"—is not a simple task. It requires an integrated understanding of
morphology, syntax, and pragmatics. This document summarizes the inherent
difficulties of glossing and presents concrete analytical guidelines for
improving precision.

### Main Text

Glossing may seem like a simple task of assigning meanings to individual words,
but in reality, it requires high-level linguistic analysis.

Take, for example, the following phrase:

> 歌よみて盃はさせ

When glossing "はさせ," it was initially labeled as `have.offer`, but this is
incorrect. It derives from the verb "sasu" (to offer a cup) in its causative
form "sase," appearing in a command-like context. Thus, it should be glossed as
`offer.CAUS.IMP`.

Why do such glossing errors occur? Below are some categorized challenges in
glossing:

#### 1. Identifying Word Boundaries

- In expressions like "hasase," particles and verbs may appear fused.
- In classical Japanese, word fusion is common; morphological segmentation is
  essential.

#### 2. Recognizing Conjugated Forms

- Is "sase" a causative, honorific, or spontaneous usage?
- One must determine based on grammatical context.

#### 3. Selecting Meaning Based on Context

- Glossing "su" simply as "do" can be misleading.
- For example, "hanamukesu" (餞す) may need to be treated as a single lexical
  verb rather than two separate components.

#### 4. Balancing Accuracy and Readability

- Oversimplified glosses reduce accuracy; overly complex glosses reduce clarity.
- For instance, `offer.CAUS.IMP` is accurate but may burden readers.

### Guidelines for Improving Gloss Accuracy

The following are core principles for future glossing efforts:

1. **Recognize Base Forms (Morphology)** → Avoid errors in identifying
   inflectional forms. Refer to comprehensive lists of auxiliary conjugations.

2. **Read Syntactic Flow (Syntax)** → Process particles, auxiliaries, and verbs
   in syntactic units.

3. **Apply Pragmatic Insight (Pragmatics)** → Choose glosses reflecting
   intention: command, wish, politeness, etc.

4. **Maintain Glossary Tags and Annotations** → For complex tags like
   `CAUS.IMP`, document them in the glossary with example usages.
