### Introduction: Adjectives are not addressed—they are uttered

In modern Japanese, expressions like _ureshii desu_, _kowakatta desu_, or _omoshiroi desu_ are commonly used. Many textbooks and grammar resources explain that adjectives are already polite forms, so the addition of _desu_ is not strictly necessary. But in this essay, I would like to propose a different view: that the plain form of adjectives (ending in _-i_) is not polite or impolite in itself, but rather **a form of inner speech—a linguistic shape that is not necessarily meant to be heard**.

---

### The indeterminacy inherent in the plain form

Words like _samui_ (cold), _ureshii_ (happy), or _omoshiroi_ (interesting) may function grammatically as complete sentences, but they do not express completed assertions or socially directed statements. They are, in essence, **emotional reactions spoken aloud**, not necessarily directed at anyone.

In this sense, the plain adjective form does not imply politeness—it simply remains **undecided**, **open**, or **ungrounded** in relation to the listener.

### The effect of “desu”: shifting the axis of speech

When _desu_ is added to an adjective, the utterance shifts from internal reflection to **external report or polite presentation**. But in doing so, it may lose the immediacy and rawness of emotion that gives the original expression its vitality.

Compare:

- _Sugoi!_ → spontaneous emotion
- _Sugoi desu ne_ → an invitation to share
- _Sugoi desu_ → polite, but emotionally flattened

This difference is not merely grammatical; it reflects a **shift in narrative stance**.

### When “self-talk” becomes a gateway to dialogue

Consider the utterance:  
**"Su... subarashii. Sensei wa dou omowaremasu ka?"**  
(_"A-amazing. What do you think, Sensei?"_)

This line embodies a beautifully layered structure of speech:

- First half: _subarashii_ → an inner reaction, unfiltered and personal
- Second half: _dou omowaremasu ka?_ → a turn toward the other, a respectful invitation

This is a case where **what begins as monologue becomes an opening for dialogue**—a self-talk that is not closed off or cold, but warmly directed outward.

### Conclusion: Emotion words are not statements, but points of origin

Adjectives like _ureshii_ or _kowai_ do not merely describe; they **disclose**. They emerge as spontaneous verbalizations of the speaker’s emotional state, often without subjects, predicates, or additional context—and yet they are fully expressive.

What matters is not whether such words are followed by _desu_, but whether they remain **available to be received**, and whether they create space for **others to respond**.

In this sense, the plain adjective form is not the end of speech, but the **starting point of a conversation**.
