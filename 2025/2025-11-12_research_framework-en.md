# The theory should be "continuously self-generating" rather than "completed"

## Abstract

This article discusses the theoretical maturity of the "Process Grammar Model."
It explores what it means for a theory to be "completed" and the importance of it being a "theory that continues to self-generate."

### 1. A theory that "continues to generate" rather than a "completed theory"

The Process Grammar Model is not a theory that "fixes its structure and ends," like many other theories (such as generative grammar and syntactic grammar), but rather a theory that embraces time within it.
The very essence of the theory is to "operate on the premise of incompleteness," meaning that the completion of the theory = stasis, and that the theory would cease to be a "Process Grammar."
In the sense that the theory is already self-sustaining as an open trajectory rather than a closed circle, it is "completed," but it is not static.

### 2. The theory is generative

For example,

- Immediate Grammar captures the moment of the speaker's action.
- Adjustive Grammar re-links that action to the language system.

These two continue to reciprocate within the theory itself.
Therefore, Process Grammar has a structure in which the theory adjusts itself.

The reason it appears to be completed is that this "self-movement" is already functioning in a clean form, not because it has stopped.

### 3. Dynamic from a human perspective

Truly completed theories are those that, even when they leave the author's hands, others can still sense their breath. They are theories that are already transmitted as processes rather than structures, which is a significant difference from other theories.

### 4. What is scientific maturity and theoretical maturity?

Such as in chemistry and physics, it is essential that theories can evolve stably when researched by individuals other than the proposers, making them truly "living theories." This desire is the essence of "theoretical maturity." This term carries a perspective that connects to fundamental sciences.
The aim is to conceive linguistics not confined within the humanities but as a system that includes "reproducibility," "extensibility," and "directions for development."

### 5. What is a "theory that evolves stably"?

Chemistry and physics theories have developed over long periods not simply because they were correct, but because reusable "variables" and "frameworks of laws" were shared in a way that other researchers could understand.

The Process Grammar Model should also meet the same conditions if research units that treat "Immediate Grammar" and "Adjustive Grammar" as variables are established.

- Immediate Grammar: conditions for utterance generation at time t₀
- Adjustive Grammar: reconstruction and reflection processes after t₁

By treating these two as observational units, other researchers should be able to experimentally and comparatively verify them.

### 6. A structure that balances stability and evolvability

The fact that a theory can "evolve" is a condition that allows for accumulation on top of it precisely because its foundation does not move. To achieve this, it is important to establish a **stable three-dimensional coordinate system** within the theory.

Concretely,

- Axis of time (immediate/adjustive)
- Psychological mode (emotional/judgmental)
- Grammatical layer (pre-syntactic/post-syntactic)

Like the above, a three-dimensional coordinate system is established as the foundation.

This coordinate system is shared so that even if other researchers add new data, AI models, or analyses of languages other than Japanese, the entire theory can be "updated" without collapsing.

### 7. Toward future research communities

Presumably, in the future, Process Grammar will be organized while connecting with peripheral fields such as:

- Education (reaction and modification time)
- AI language models (immediate generation and re-evaluation)
- Poetics and rhetoric (breath and syntax)

With coordination of the above these peripheral areas, it will likely be organized.
When a theory passes into the hands of others, it becomes "shared science." As a first step toward that, it is good to prepare formalization and systematic descriptions.
