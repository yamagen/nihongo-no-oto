### Summary

The narrative style of the _Ise Monogatari_ often gives the reader a feeling that "something feels off." But this very feeling of dissonance turns out to be a key to its beauty. Beneath a surface of sparse descriptions—"he went," "he slept," "he composed a poem"—lie layers of hesitation, strategy, and poetic self-defense. Once I recognized this, the entire text opened up with new meaning.

### Main Text

Reading the _Ise Monogatari_, I kept thinking, "Something’s strange about this."

"He did this." "He went there." "He composed a poem." The narration felt too simple, almost like a list of events with no emotional weight. I didn’t know where or how to start reading between the lines.

But finally, it clicked.

That strange simplicity wasn’t naivety—it was intentional.

**The text hides emotion by refusing to state it.**

The narrator—Ariwara no Narihira—refers to himself only as "the man." He tells stories of being tricked, humiliated, composing poems out of regret. But he never says, "I felt this way." Instead, he distances himself, speaking as if about someone else.

That’s why readers are forced to interpret what isn’t said. And in those silences, you begin to see what’s really happening: sincerity, embarrassment, clever setups, all playing out behind the minimal prose.

"He composed a poem." —But to whom? Why then? Why those words?

The story doesn’t say.
And yet, it says everything.

That’s the brilliance of the _Ise Monogatari_, and the cunning of Narihira’s voice. He isn’t straightforward. He’s not meant to be. And now, I’ve come to see that as the entire point.
