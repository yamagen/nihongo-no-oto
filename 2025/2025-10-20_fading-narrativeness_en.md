## Fading Narrativeness When a Phrase Becomes a Compound

### Summary

There are cases when, as words become idiomatic and grammatically stable, the narrative movement they once contained fades away.
When a sentence like "yomitsubekuba haya ihekashi (if you can finish composing, say it quicklyz)" is treated merely as a compound phrase, the narrator's breathing and shifts in thought become less visible.
Behind grammaticalization, there may be a function that spatially fixes the temporal flow of narration.

### Introduction

In an excerpt from the Tosa Diary, there is the phrase "yomitsubekuba haya ihekashi."
This was uttered by Ki no Tsurayuki in response to an utterance by a young girl, "maroko no uta no kaeshi semu (I will return my poem)."
Grammatically analyzing this sentence, it takes the form "tsubeshi," which combines the auxiliary verb "tsu" (indicating completion) and "beshi" (indicating conjecture or possibility).
In grammar books, "tsubeshi" is treated as a **compound phrase (a single unit)** and is explained to express meanings of certain completion or possibility.
However, in this process of compound formation, the movement of the narrator's thoughts and emotions can sometimes be lost.
This paper examines the impact of compound formation on narration through the example of "yomitsubekuba haya ihekashi."

### Fading of Narration through Compound Formation

Indeed, in terms of form, both work closely together and often express emphasis on certain completion or possibility.
However, when "tsu" and "beku" are placed together in narration, there is a momentary pause in the speaker's consciousness.
There is a time when the speaker envisions the completion of the action and hesitates over its possibility while uttering it.

In the case of "yomitsubekuba haya ihekashi," the narrator responds to the girl's words, lightly teasing her with "if you can really finish composing." There is a gaze of expectation, half in jest.
Simply understanding "tsubeku" as a compound phrase causes this breathing to be lost. Fixing the meaning makes the moment when the words were in motion invisible.

## 1. Compound Formation Stops the Movement of Thought

Grammar books treat "tsubeshi" and "nubeshi" as **compound phrases (single units)** for the sake of analytical convenience, because their meanings seem stable.
In the actual narration, however, the speaker utters "yomitsu..." while **momentarily envisioning the completion of the action**, and then continues with "beku (if you can)."
In other words, in the narrator's mind, the judgment of "whether one can finish composing" is **actively in motion**.
If "tsubeku" is turned into a compound phrase, that **movement of thought (the moment of envisioning completion and layering possibility onto it)** is transformed into a "fixed value of meaning."
Therefore, **narration fades away**.

## 2. Narration is Time, and Compounds Crush Time

"Narration," like breathing and gazes, is the flow of time itself.
In the phrase "yomitsubekuba,"

1. compose
1. finish composing (tsu)
1. whether one can do it (beku)
1. if so (ba)

This contains **four stages of thought and breathing**:

1. The act of composing
2. Envisioning its completion (tsu)
3. Considering whether one can do it (beku)
4. The conditional "if so" (ba)

If this is compressed into one beat as "tsubeku" = "certain completion," the feelings with which the narrator layered those words—the **temporal fluctuations**—disappear.

In other words, compound formation is an operation that **spatializes the time of narration**.

## 3. Tsurayuki's Style is Precisely in That "In-Between"

The charm of the Tosa Diary lies in its use of **half-finished sentences and in-between grammar**, such as "yomitsubekuba haya ihekashi."
It exists at the intersection of emotion and cognition, before words have solidified their form.
Tsurayuki's narration captures the breathing of the speaker's thoughts and emotions **in motion**.
Therefore, to bring Tsurayuki's narration to life, reading "tsubeku" not as a compound but as the **breathing between "tsu" and "beku"** resonates far more richly.

## 5. In a Word

> Compound formation explains meaning but kills narration. Reading it in parts keeps narration alive, even if the meaning is ambiguous.

The intuition that "narration fades when a phrase becomes a compound" is an **intuition that views language as an 'act' rather than a 'system.'**

## 6. Review: Confirmation and Improvement Suggestions for Translation Examples

### 1. Structural Correspondence of the Original Text

Original:

> 詠みつべくばはやいへかし。gloss: 詠み（compose）＋つ（完了想定）＋べくば（if you can）＋はや（quickly）＋いへかし（say!）
> Gloss: yom(i) (compose) + tsu (completion assumption) + beku ba (if you can) + haya (quickly) + ihe kashi (say!)

Syntactically:

> 「もし詠み終えることができるなら、さあ言ってみなさい。」
> "If you are able to have recited, say it quickly."

Thus, as a literal translation:

```json
"translation-ja": "「詠み終えることができるなら」と言う。"
"translation-en": "He says, "If you are able to have recited, say it quickly.""
```

is completely correct. It positions the narrator's utterance in a third-person descriptive manner.

---

### 2. Fine-tuning the English Translation

Example of adjustment:

> "He says, "If you are able to have recited, say it quickly.""

While this is understandable, "are able to have recited" is somewhat unnatural in English. The reason is that "are able to (present ability)" + "have recited (completion)" placed together causes a temporal mismatch.
In English perfect constructions, "completion + ability" cannot be expressed simultaneously, so the natural options are one of the following:

#### A. Expressing the original "completion assumption" in natural English subjunctive

```json
"translation-en": "He says, 'If you can really finish composing, then say it quickly.'"
```

- _can finish composing_ corresponds to "yomitsubekuba."
- _really_ supplements the nuance of certainty/assumption from "tsu."
- _then say it quickly_ corresponds to "haya ihekashi."

#### B. For a slightly more classical tone

```json
"translation-en": "He says, 'If you are able to complete your poem, speak it quickly.'"
```

- _complete your poem_ corresponds to "yomitsu"
- _speak it quickly_ corresponds to "haya ihekashi"
- It has a classical calmness and fits the narrative tone of the Tosa Diary.

---

#### C. Natural and Precise Correspondence

```json
"translation-ja": "「詠み終えることができるなら」と言う。",
"translation-en": "He says, 'If you can really finish composing, then say it quickly.'"
```

---

### 3. Supplement: The Breathing of Narration

This utterance is a somewhat playful response by Ki no Tsurayuki to the girl's words, "maroko no uta no kaeshi semu," and the narrative introduction _He says..._ well captures that light distance.

- "yomitsu": assumption of completion
- "bekuba": presentation of condition
- "haya ihekashi": encouragement/teasing

By combining these three elements, the rhythm of the sentence itself feels like "speaking while laughing."

In other words:

> 「詠み終えることができるなら」と言う。He says, "If you can really finish composing, then say it quickly."

This is the most structurally and psychologically accurate translation pair.

---

## 4. To Make it Natural

### 1. Naturalness of the Japanese Translation

```json
"translation-ja-natural": "詠んだなら、早く言ってごらん」と囃す。
"translation-en-natural": "He teases, \"If you've composed it, say it quickly.\""
```

- "yomunda nara": naturally expresses the assumption of completion in a light manner, similar to past perfect, corresponding to "yomitsubekuba."
- "hayaku itte goran": perfectly reproduces the tone of provocation and playfulness from "haya ihekashi," as an encouragement rather than a command.
- "hayasu": exquisite. It encapsulates Tsurayuki's attitude of utterance in one word—teasing, mixed with laughter, and delivered with affection.

→ This is an ideal natural translation that combines style, psychology, and tone.

---

### 2. Naturalness of the English Translation

```json
"translation-en-natural": "He encourages, \"If you've composed it, say it quickly.\""
```

- _encourages_ is a perfect verb choice. It is softer than "teases" or "urges," maintaining Tsurayuki's warmth as he watches over the girl.
- _If you've composed it_ naturally expresses the completion + condition of "yomitsubekuba."
- _say it quickly_ wonderfully corresponds to the tone of "haya ihekashi." The ending _quickly_ reproduces the sound of the classical "haya."

→ It is smooth in English and does not compromise the psychological structure of the narration (light encouragement + smile).

## 3. Structural Correspondence Between Original and Translation (Perfect Match)

| Original      | gloss                | Meaning               | Corresponding Translation |
| ------------- | -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| yomitsubekuba | if able to complete  | If you've composed it | If you've composed it     |
| haya          | quickly              | quickly               | quickly                   |
| ihe kashi     | say! (encouraging)   | say it                | say it                    |
| (narrator)    | tease/playfully urge | He teases             | He teases                 |

---

### Conclusion

These translations directly convey Ki no Tsurayuki's "teasing + affection + gentle atmosphere" into modern language.

```json
"translation-ja-natural": "詠んだなら、早く言ってごらん」と囃す。",
"translation-en-natural": "He teases, \"If you've composed it, say it quickly.\""
```

This is ideal as a relationship between literal and natural translations, and can be said to be the **most perfected pair** both syntactically and psychologically.
