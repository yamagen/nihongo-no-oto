## Summary

A word-for-word translation aims to reproduce the structure of the original text as faithfully as possible.
It does not need to be natural English. In fact, it should not be smoothed or normalized.

## 1. Do not change the original word order

The order in which words appear in the original must be kept in the translation.
Changing the order makes structural recognition impossible.

- Original: A -> B -> C
- Translation: A -> B -> C (same order)

Classical Japanese word order reflects the writer's flow of thought.
Reorganizing the sentence is the reader's operation, and has no place in a word-for-word translation.

## 2. Keep one-to-one correspondence at the word level (do not add what is absent in the original)

Word-for-word translation follows the principle of interpretation zero.

- Do not supply a subject
- Do not supply an object
- Do not specify referents
- Do not add emotional nuance
- Do not infer from context

Every word that appears in the original must have a corresponding element in the translation.
Words that do not appear in the original must not be inserted.

Example: "hito-wo-ba" -> "hito-wo".
Even if the context makes it clear that it means "you", we do not add "you".

Even if the result is awkward, preserving the sequence of the original words is the top priority.
If you smooth the translation here, you erase the very question of why the original is shaped that way.

## 3. Preserve the function of particles and auxiliary verbs

Particles and auxiliary verbs define the structure of the sentence.
The translation must show their functional role in some visible form.

Examples:

- ba -> "because" / "when" (reason / sequence)
- do -> "but" (concession)
- tsu -> "-did" (completion)
- keri -> "-was" (past / narrative awareness)

These correspondences are not semantic translations but functional indicators.
If you break the grammatical category, the original structure disappears.

## 4. Do not attempt to repair logical consistency

In classical texts, the viewpoint or emotional stance may shift between the beginning and end of a sentence.
This is natural, and the translator should not try to "fix" it.

The word-for-word translation focuses purely on structural presentation.
Restoring consistency is the task of the natural (interpretive) translation later.

## 5. It may be awkward Japanese (or English), and that is fine

A word-for-word translation is an intermediate pedagogical representation. Naturalness is not the goal.

Example:
"ito tsuraku," -> "very painfully,"

This deliberate awkwardness makes the structure and sequence of the original visible.

- twists in the original
- the writer's habits of ordering
- hesitation or shifts of judgment mid-sentence

These often disappear in natural translation, so the word-for-word version must keep them.

## 6. Respect the possibility of shifting consciousness mid-sentence

Classical texts were not written after fully organizing the entire sentence logically.
The writer's awareness may change partway through, and this is an important feature.

If the translator smooths the text, the temporal flow of the writer's thought is destroyed.

## 7. Word-for-word translation is not an answer; it is a structural trace

The goal is to reveal the structure of the original without dismantling it.

What a word-for-word translation presents:

- word order
- particles and auxiliary markers
- sentence structure
- the shape of the grammatical sequence

Interpretation is performed only afterwards, in the natural translation and commentary.

1. Did you keep the original word order?
2. Did you avoid adding words not in the text?
3. Are the functions of particles and auxiliaries visible?
