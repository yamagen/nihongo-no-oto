### Main Text

"Mattete kureta nda."
"Tetsudatte kureta nda."
You don't see the word "thank you" in these phrases. But you can feel it.

Anyone hearing these expressions instantly recognizes the speaker's happiness and gratitude.
They're deeply emotional responses, even though they seem structurally simple.

That's why they rarely appear in textbooks or grammar references.
There's no explicit sign of politeness or thanks.

But the structure says everything.
"Kureta" shows that someone did something for you.
"Nda" adds a note of discovery, realization, or rising emotion.

Add a "ne" or a soft "no?" at the end, and it becomes even more intimate and warm.
This is what we call *immediate grammar*—language that arises naturally from the situation and emotion.
