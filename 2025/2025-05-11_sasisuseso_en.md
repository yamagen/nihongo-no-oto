### Introduction: The Enigmatic Phrase "eshi mo koso shi ie"

The phrase "eshi mo koso shi ie" found in the _Tosa Nikki_ is difficult to interpret both grammatically and semantically for modern readers. In context, it appears when Ki no Tsurayuki withholds a verbal reaction after sensing someone dismissing his poem. The sentence structure involves complex elements such as kakarimusubi (correlative particles), ellipsis, and fusion of forms, making it far from transparent at a glance.

### Grammatical Breakdown

The phrase can be broken down into the following components:

- **e**: An adverb indicating impossibility (e.g., e\~zu "cannot")
- **shi**: Interpreted here as a pronominal use, meaning "that kind of thing" (i.e., koto)
- **mo**: Emphatic particle
- **koso**: Correlative particle requiring an izen (realis) verb form
- **ie**: Interpreted as the izen form of the verb "iu" (to say)

This structure yields a meaning such as: "How could one possibly say such a thing? (No, one cannot)," reflecting emphatic negation or exclamatory denial.

### Variant Text and Kikuchi's Emendation

Professor Yoshiaki Kikuchi offers an emended reading:

> "Funakimi no karaku, hineridashite, yoshi to omoeru koto o, onji mo koso shi tamabe." Tote, tsutsumekite yami nu.

Here, "onji" is the continuative form of _onzu_ (to resent), "shi" is the continuative form of _suru_ (to do), and "tamabe" is the izen form of the quadrigrade honorific verb _tabu_. The structure means, "Please do not be angry." While syntactically clear, it differs substantially from the original variant "eshi mo koso shi ie."

### Interpreting "shi" as a Pronominal Element

While "shi" might first appear to be the attributive form of the past auxiliary _ki_, it aligns more naturally—given the syntax and context—with a pronominal reading referring back to "yoshi to omoeru koto." Such a use of _shi_ is frequent in Heian literature, where a single hiragana character can point to previously mentioned ideas or events.

### The Structure and Function of "sa-shi-su-se-so"

The phonetic series "sa, shi, su, se, so," including "shi" in this context, frequently serve as core functional elements in Classical Japanese. They express modality, deixis, agency, and location, among other roles:

- **sa**: Indicative of manner or state (e.g., _samo_, _saware_)
- **si**: Refers to events or propositions (shi/si = "thing")
- **su**: Verbalization or action-execution (su = "to do")
- **se**: Causative or mediative (e.g., _seshimu_, _seshimeru_)
- **so**: The "so" series in the ko-so-a-do demonstrative system, indicating other-directed deixis

Though each form appears minimal, they function as grammatical and stylistic anchors in waka and kana prose, condensing meaning while shaping rhythm.

### Poetic Density through Single-Hiragana Words

Consider the famous _Kokinshū_ poem by Mibu no Tadamine:

> _wa ga mi yo ni furu nagame se shi ma ni_

Here, the one-character words _se_, _shi_, _ma_, and _ni_ follow in sequence, each fulfilling a grammatical role—auxiliary, conjunctive, case marking, etc. The compactness allows the poem's meaning to ride the wave of sound, creating multilayered resonance in the reader's mind.

### Conclusion: The Limits and Possibilities of Sound-Based Classical Grammar

The phrase "eshi mo koso shi ie" highlights how Classical Japanese meaning emerges not solely from individual word definitions but from sound flow, syntax, and contextual positioning. Single-hiragana words often defy strict interpretation while enhancing poetic intensity. This inherent ambiguity is precisely what grants waka and kana prose their richness and lingering depth.
