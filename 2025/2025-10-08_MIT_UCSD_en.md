### Summary

Reflecting on my time at MIT in the 1990s and UCSD in 1998,
I recall two different landscapes of learning:
the wooden buildings of Boston where academic freedom was built by hand,
and the ocean winds of San Diego where I encountered the idea of language as a process in time.
These are memories from an era when scholarship still breathed through human hands.

### Main Text

#### Boston — The City of Wooden Buildings and Stone Chessboards

In the 1990s, learning was still woven into everyday life in Boston.

On the MIT campus stood the old **Building 20**,
a wooden structure left over from World War II.
It was so simple that its walls could be taken down at will;
researchers rewired the rooms themselves and shaped their own laboratories.
That freedom to *make one’s own space* embodied the spirit of MIT.

On the first floor was the computing cluster called **Athena**.
No matter which terminal you used, your own environment would appear,
and you could submit assignments, send mail, and connect with the world.
At a time when the internet still felt special,
MIT had already made it part of daily life.

One evening, near the Kendall MIT station,
I saw **rms (Richard Stallman)** walking down the street.
His distinct hair and figure were unmistakable.
He was the man who believed that *sharing technology is a way to defend human freedom.*
It was only a passing moment, but I felt that his presence
embodied the roots of MIT’s intellectual ethos.

Inside the same building hung a photograph of **Noam Chomsky**.
He once said, “Because university professors cannot be fired,
they have the responsibility to speak for the powerless.”
That idea stayed with me.
Language and politics, theory and ethics;
at MIT, these seemingly distant spheres coexisted in quiet harmony.

Walking through Boston, I could sense freedom in the air.
At Harvard Square, a string quartet played softly,
while older men moved their chess pieces silently on stone boards.
A short ride north on the Green Line led to the **Museum of Science**,
where children cheered before a display of the normal distribution.
Small balls dropped from above,
bouncing through pegs until they formed a perfect bell curve;
an accidental symmetry of order born from chance.
Watching them, I felt a kind of envy for those children
who could grow up surrounded by science.

Once you become an adult, you can never truly return to being a child.
And yet, perhaps to continue studying is
to keep *a fragment of wonder* alive as you grow older.

#### San Diego — Syntax in the Wind

Several years later, in 1998,
I spent time at **UCSD (University of California, San Diego)**
through a visiting scholar program from the University of Tsukuba.
I wanted to reconsider the *heat of freedom* I had felt at MIT,
this time in the quiet wind of the Pacific.

The UCSD campus lay close to the sea.
Breezes passed between the research buildings,
and squirrels ran across the lawns.
Where Boston was made of stone,
San Diego was made of light and air.

At that time, I was deeply interested in **Jeff Elman**,
a researcher who viewed language as *a structure that unfolds in time.*
He proposed the **Simple Recurrent Network (SRN)**,
a neural model that treated grammar not as a static system
but as a *process of dynamic computation.*
This idea would later give rise to **RNNs**, **LSTMs**,
and the modern AI architectures that followed.
Elman was a gentle man, always bright-eyed,
and he spoke of time, memory, and prediction
as three aspects of a single continuous flow.
The roots of my own ideas of “immediate grammar” and “process grammar”
were surely planted in the winds of UCSD.

Another unforgettable figure was **Ric Atkinson**,
then Chancellor of UCSD and a renowned educational psychologist.
In Japan, his name often appeared in literature on CAI
(Computer-Assisted Instruction).
One evening, by chance, I saw him at a restaurant
and was introduced briefly.
In a calm voice he said,
“Education is the art of assisting human thought.”
That line stayed with me—not as a statement of technology,
but as a philosophy of education itself.
Later, Atkinson became President of the entire UC system,
extending the *structure of education* to society at large.

Both Elman and Atkinson explored
the *process* of human knowledge in their own ways.
If MIT taught me *how to think freely*,
then UCSD taught me *how thought itself flows*.
In the sunlight by the ocean,
I reexamined language, learning, and the human mind—
all as ongoing processes rather than finished forms.

### Epilogue — When Academic Landscapes Move

The stone streets of Boston
and the sea winds of San Diego
are connected by a single line in my memory.

At MIT, I saw freedom built by human hands.
At UCSD, I felt syntax carried by the wind of time.
What I witnessed in those two places
still lives quietly at the root of my research and teaching today.

Scholarship is not in buildings or institutions,
but in the *winds of memory* that one feels in each moment and place.
