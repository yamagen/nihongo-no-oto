### Summary

Both "... to sugu" and "...te sugu ni" appear to mean "immediately after," but the contexts in which they can be used differ in important ways. This article considers why the expression "Ie ni kaeru to sugu, denwa ga natta" ("As soon as I got home, the phone rang") sounds unnatural.

### Main Text

"... to sugu" is an immediate grammar expression that shows the **second event is triggered by the first and occurs almost at the same moment**.
Examples:

* Doa o akeru to sugu, neko ga tobidashita.
  (*As soon as I opened the door, a cat jumped out.*)
* Suwaru to sugu, nemutte shimatta.
  (*As soon as I sat down, I fell asleep.*)

Here, actions like "open" or "sit" are instantaneous, and they trigger another event right away.

On the other hand, "ie ni kaeru" ("to return home") contains the idea of **arrival and completion**. Once completion is explicitly stated, the next event can only come *afterward*. In this sense, "kaeru to sugu" conflicts with the immediacy implied by "to sugu." This is why "Ie ni kaeru to sugu, denwa ga natta" feels unnatural.

The natural phrasing is "kaette sugu":

* Ie ni kaette sugu, denwa ga natta.
  (*Immediately after I got home, the phone rang.*)
* Gogatsu ni natte sugu, shiken ga atta.
  (*As soon as May began, there was an exam.*)

Here, the connective particle "te" explicitly marks the sequence "completion â†’ right after," so there is no sense of contradiction.

### Notes

* "to sugu" = instantaneous action + external event happening immediately
* "te sugu" = completed action + the next event right afterward
* This distinction should not be directly explained to learners. It should be internalized through usage. For teachers, it serves as a memo to understand why certain sentences are natural or unnatural.
