### Summary

The expression "sonna hi mo aru" (Some days are just like that) is a quintessential example of immediate grammar—language that accepts a whole experience without explicitly describing it. While university settings often demand concrete explanations, real language use often thrives on what is not made explicit, and this ambiguity is often the starting point of meaningful communication.

### Main Text

"Sonna hi mo aru."

When someone reflects on a day that didn't go well, or whispers it to themselves at the end of an exhausting evening, this phrase is not merely comforting—it's a kind of linguistic magic that puts into words what can't be fully articulated.

But what exactly is "sonna hi" (that kind of day)? If asked to explain in concrete terms, many would be at a loss. The day may not have any clearly definable features. And yet, the listener nods—"yeah, totally," or "happens to me too"—and the interaction flows on.

From the perspective of Paul Grice's pragmatics, this may be seen as a gentle violation of the maxims of Quantity or Manner. Yet communication does not break down. In fact, such vagueness often supports it, enabling the listener to emotionally align with the speaker.

In foreign language education, students are often taught to be explicit and grammatically precise. But we must not forget that in real-life conversation, it is expressions like "sonna," "konna," and "kou iu"—immediate, context-sensitive, and abstract—that keep interaction alive.

Language, at its core, is not merely about what is said, but about how it is spoken and how it is received. "Sonna hi mo aru" may be structurally simple, but it gains rich meaning through relationship and emotional resonance.

This is the very essence of immediate grammar.
