## Summary

- The Japanese word aru ("to exist, there is") directly refers to the existence of something in reality.  
- In contrast, nai ("not, there is not") brings into language something that does not exist in reality, thus crossing the boundary between the world of signs and the real world.  
- The phenomena surrounding nai provide a useful theme that bridges theoretical linguistics and pragmatics.

## Main Text

### Introduction

- Musuu (literally "no-number") does not mean that there are no numbers, but rather "so many that they cannot be counted."  
- "Musuu no hoshi ga kagayaku" ("Countless stars shine") means that a very large number of stars are shining.  
- "Then, professor, munou ('no-ability') must mean not that one lacks ability, but that one has very high ability, right?"  
- "No, munou really does mean lacking ability after all."  

This exchange shows that negative expressions do not always mean "negation."  
Musuu does not mean "no numbers," but rather "countless, infinitely many," which is a positive meaning.  
Munoo, however, remains a pure negation.  

Another set of examples shows the same point:  

- Shudan o erabanai ("not choosing means") does not mean "choosing none," but rather "using any means." In effect, one ends up choosing some means.  
- Doogu o erabanai ("not choosing tools") similarly means "using any tools," not "choosing none." In effect, one ends up choosing some tools.  

These examples serve as a starting point for classifying cases where a negative expression does not remain purely negative, and for asking how such cases can be described in theoretical linguistics.

### First Task: Typology of Non-Negative Negative Expressions

Negative expressions sometimes function not as negation but as inclusion or affirmation.  
They can be organized into three main types:

1. **Inclusive type (total affirmation)**  
   - A negative form is used but results in affirming "all."  
   - Example: Shudan o erabanai = "use any means."  
   - Doogu o erabanai is similar.  

2. **Categorizing type (a category named with 'non-')**  
   - A negative label creates a new category.  
   - Example: Musabetsu-kyuu ("no-weight-class") = the new category of "open-weight class."  
   - Musuu belongs here as well: not "no numbers," but "so many that they cannot be counted."  

3. **Paradoxical type (affirmation through negation)**  
   - A negative expression is used as emphasis, paradoxically yielding affirmation.  
   - Example: Kotoba ni naranai ("cannot be put into words") = yet in the end, expressed with words.  

> **Research Question**  
> Are these three types sufficient, or should we posit an additional meta-negation type, such as nai ga nai ("there is no 'not'")?  
> This case denies negation itself, entirely lacking reference to reality, and raises a new challenge for theoretical linguistics.

### Second Task: Can Theoretical Linguistics Account for This?

#### Research Question (proposal)
"Can phenomena in which a negative form does not yield negation be accounted for within the frameworks of theoretical linguistics (formal semantics, polarity theory, studies of negation), or do we need pragmatic or cognitive approaches?"  

#### Directions of Inquiry
- **Lexical polysemy**: mu- compounds cover pure negation (munoo, "no ability"), quantificational extension (Musuu, "countless"), category creation (Musabetsu-kyuu, "open-weight class"), and paradoxical emphasis (Kotoba ni naranai).  
- **Extension of polarity theory**: Beyond NPIs and PPIs, there may be a class of "paradoxical polarity items."  
- **Integration into quantificational theory**: Musuu can be formalized as "mu = infinity."  
- **Two-layer model of meaning**: Negation leading to inclusion or emphasis requires theoretical modeling of meaning shifts.  

#### On Terminology
- **Advantages**:  
  - Helps clarify classification and conceptual distinctions.  
  - Labels such as "inclusive type" or "categorizing type" facilitate reference.  
- **Risks**:  
  - Proliferation of labels can obscure the central phenomenon.  
  - Overemphasis on nuances ("intersection," "conversion," "coexistence") can distract from the real problem: how to explain the phenomenon theoretically.  

#### Conclusion
Nai lacks direct physical correspondence with reality, so theoretical linguistics is inevitably forced to take actual language use into account when describing its meaning.  
This is not a retreat into pragmatics, but a strengthening of theory itself.  
By confronting nai head-on, theoretical linguistics can be expanded into a stronger and more comprehensive framework.

### Third Task: What Does Linguistics Describe?

#### Research Question (proposal)
- Linguistics has traditionally developed as a discipline describing the structure and functions of language.  
- Yet when pursued to its limit, the phenomenon of "negative expressions that do not function as negation" forces us to describe human thought itself (ways of construing negation, ways of shifting meaning).  
- Therefore:  
  - "Language functions" and "human thought" cannot be separated.  
  - Linguistics, through the study of language functions, must also be a discipline that describes human thought in theoretical terms.  

---

### Flow of the Three Tasks
1. **First Task**: Classify cases where negative expressions are not negative and explore their scope.  
2. **Second Task**: Examine whether these can be described within theoretical linguistics.  
3. **Third Task**: Conclude that linguistics must inevitably describe human thought, not just language functions, and that this too belongs to theoretical linguistics.

### Why nai Is a Convenient Focus

1. **Relation to the First Task**  
   - Shudan o erabanai, Doogu o erabanai = inclusive type.  
   - Kotoba ni naranai = paradoxical type.  
   - Musuu = categorizing type.  
   → Nai alone provides concrete examples of all three types.  

2. **Relation to the Second Task**  
   - As an auxiliary verb, nai is syntactically the clear negation operator [NEG].  
   - But semantically it extends into inclusion, emphasis, and quantification.  
   → Thus nai is a perfect test case for theoretical linguistics.  

3. **Relation to the Third Task**  
   - Nai is used to mean aru ("exist") or "many."  
   - Nai koto mo nai ("it is not that it is not...") expresses ambiguity of thought.  
   - Hence nai embodies the duality of language function and human thought.
