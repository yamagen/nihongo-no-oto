### Summary

This text contains a sample lecture script demonstrating the structure of spontaneous speech in English. By stringing together short sentences, asking the
audience questions, and immediately negating or confirming them, it becomes a kind of live performance of "immediate grammar" in English.

### Main Text

**1. Wittgenstein**  
If you want to ride a bike, are you gonna examine it structurally?  
It's not an experiment, is it?  
You just ride, fall, and repeat.  
Language is the same.  
Use is language itself.  
Don't spend too much time analyzing.  
Just use it.

---

**2. Grammars**  
In almost all languages, word order is relatively free.  
So if you hit upon what you want to say, just say it at once.  
Your own language has free word order.  
Japanese does too.  
By coincidence, you’re speaking in the right order.  
Got it?

---

**3. Mistakes**  
People don't care about what you're gonna say.  
No one cares about you.  
But don't take it the wrong way.  
People care about what you say — not your grammar mistakes.  
That's true.

---

**4. Preparations**  
Prepare the content, not the grammar.  
Focus on ideas, not structures.

---

**5. Pretend**  
If you don't understand, pretend you do.  
Just nod and act as if you know everything.  
Having said that, that's true.  
Which is the most difficult skill among speaking, writing, listening, and reading?  
(Silence)  
Speaking?  
No, no, no.  
Speaking is the easiest skill among the four.  
Yes, yes it is.  
It’s listening.  
Because you cannot control the topic your partner will say.  
All you can do is just listen.  
But soon, you will get tired of it because you don't understand.  
No matter what language it is.  
In that case, pretend you understand — as if you understand very well.  
Instead, you should learn useful words to pretend you understand.  
Because pretending to know is something you already do in your own language.  
You also need it in a foreign language.

**6. Purpose of Language**  
Do you know what the purpose of language is?  
It’s nothing. No purpose.  
If you have dinner with your close friends, are you going to prepare topics to talk about?  
You're not gonna do that.  
In that sense, nothing.  
However, you are always thinking that you wish to keep a human relationship with her.  
For that, you need language.

---

**7. Tips**  
If you want to talk to Japanese people — maybe a cute girl or a wealthy-looking guy — don't talk to them directly.  
Talk to their dogs.  
Hello, puppy! Even if you're huge — hello, hello. What's your name?  
Then she will notice and ask you, "Where are you from?"  
If you talk to her directly, you’re gonna look totally weird.  
Don't do that.

---

That is it.  
Good night, everybody.
