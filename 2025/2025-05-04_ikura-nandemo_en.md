### Summary

Inspired by an AEAD entry on the expression “ikura nande mo...”, I realized that I had never once taught this phrase in a classroom setting. This reflection explores what it means for an expression to be unteachable, focusing on the emotional immediacy, omission, and context-dependence of the phrase.

### Essay

**Ikura nande mo.**  
It’s an expression frequently heard in casual conversation, and yet—despite being a Japanese language teacher—I have never taught it.

This realization came while working on my AEAD project (_An Expression A Day_), where I document naturally occurring spoken expressions one per day, grounded in the framework of Immediate Grammar. As I recorded “ikura nande mo...”, I caught myself thinking: “Wait—I’ve never taught this one.”

There are likely several reasons.

It doesn’t fit neatly into grammar books or textbooks.  
It doesn’t form a complete sentence and often ends in an open clause.  
It typically arises at emotional intersections—surprise, protest, shared disbelief.  
And above all, it is nearly impossible to _recreate_ authentically in a classroom.

But it’s used.  
Often.  
Instantly, with emotional weight.

In language education, there exists an invisible divide between _what should be taught_ and _what cannot be taught but is crucial_. “Ikura nande mo” may be the epitome of the latter.

Learners likely first encounter this phrase through native conversation or media. But how much of its **timing**, **hesitation**, and **difficulty** of saying can they really grasp?  
Its meaning does not lie in grammar but in **context**, **emotion**, and **silence**.

In AEAD entry No. 389, I recorded the following:

> “Ikura nande mo, sore wa nai n ja nai?”

What follows—pauses, half-spoken words, eyes seeking agreement—all of it builds the meaning of “ikura nande mo.”

A phrase I never taught.  
But an important one.  
So I write it down here, to remember it.
