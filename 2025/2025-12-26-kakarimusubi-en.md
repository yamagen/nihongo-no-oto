## Abstract

This paper aims to reconsider immediate utterance expressions observed in modern Japanese in terms of their continuity with _kakarimusubi_ in classical Japanese, from the perspective of principles governing speech production. _Kakarimusubi_ has often been described as a grammatical phenomenon that disappeared as a result of the loss of the morphological opposition between the sentence-final and attributive forms, as well as changes in the functions of focus particles. However, such accounts rely heavily on surface forms observable in written sources, and it remains open to question whether they adequately take into account properties inherent to spoken language, such as temporality, interactionality, and the incompleteness of utterances.

In this paper, _kakarimusubi_ is approached not as a fixed grammatical rule, but as a type of operation performed by speakers in the course of utterance production, including extraction, focalization, and the maintenance of unrecovered predication. From this viewpoint, there does not necessarily appear to be a principled discontinuity between constructions involving attributive-form endings and focus particles in classical Japanese, and sentence-final particles, utterance-final forms, intonation, or suspended expressions in modern Japanese. What has been described as the "disappearance" of _kakarimusubi_ may reflect not the loss of an underlying principle of speech, but rather the fact that such principles became increasingly difficult to describe within the framework of written grammar.

Furthermore, while expressions that convey a sense of continuation or unfinished predication have rarely been treated systematically in Japanese language education, it is often observed that non-native speakers who acquire Japanese through everyday interaction come to use such expressions naturally. This suggests that the principles related to _kakarimusubi_ may have continued to function in human linguistic activity, both historically and in the present.

Accordingly, this paper examines whether _kakarimusubi_ can be reconsidered not as a grammatical phenomenon that definitively disappeared, but as an immediate principle of utterance production that has operated consistently from classical Japanese through modern Japanese.

## 1. Introduction

_Kakarimusubi_ in classical Japanese has traditionally been explained as a grammatical phenomenon that disappeared due to the collapse of the morphological distinction between sentence-final and attributive forms. As these forms became identical, the correspondence between focus particles and verb endings could no longer be maintained, and _kakarimusubi_ came to be regarded as no longer functioning as a systematic grammatical category.

Such explanations, however, are based primarily on changes in surface forms observable in written materials, and do not fully capture the functional role that _kakarimusubi_ played in spoken language. In particular, because traditional grammatical descriptions have taken the "completed sentence" as their basic unit of analysis, structures in which predication is temporarily suspended and meaning is negotiated through interaction with the listener have tended to fall outside the scope of description.

This paper adopts the position that the so-called "disappearance" of _kakarimusubi_ should be understood not as the disappearance of a linguistic phenomenon itself, but as its becoming less visible within the framework of written grammar. By comparing _kakarimusubi_ in classical Japanese with immediate and suspended utterance expressions in modern Japanese from the perspective of continuity in speech principles, this paper seeks to reframe _kakarimusubi_ not as a historically exceptional rule, but as one manifestation of structures consistently involved in human speech activity.

## 2. Problems in Surface-Oriented Grammatical Accounts of _Kakarimusubi_

To examine _kakarimusubi_ from the perspective of utterance principles, this section considers several representative examples.

(1) _Toki ni arikeru onna no warawa namu kono uta o yomeru_
(2) _Tori no naku_
(3) _Omae koso itta..._
(4) _Kore tabenai no_
(5) _Kore zo Nihon danji_

In example (1), the focus particle _namu_ triggers the attributive form _yomeru_. Traditionally, this attributive form has been treated as a modifier requiring a following noun, often assumed to be omitted. However, _yomeru_ here already functions as a complete predication of an event, and does not require the supplementation of a specific noun in order to be understood. Rather, it is more natural to interpret this construction as presenting the predication while deliberately keeping it unrecovered, thereby preparing for the subsequent presentation of the song itself.

A similar structure can be observed in expressions such as _tori no naku_. Although formally attributive and thus easily analyzed as noun-modifying constructions, these expressions do not in fact presuppose the presence of a following noun. What is at work here is an operation whereby a situation or action is first brought into focus, with its evaluation or further development deferred to subsequent discourse. The attributive form functions not to restrict a noun, but to keep the predication open and pass it on to the next stage of narration.

This kind of unrecovered predication can also be observed continuously in modern Japanese. In example (3), _omae koso itta..._, responsibility is strongly foregrounded, while the predication itself is intentionally left suspended, inviting a reaction from the interlocutor. When a phrase such as _janai ka_ is added, the suspended predication is immediately recovered and transformed into a confirmation or accusation. This illustrates how the character of an utterance can change significantly depending on the timing of recovery.

In example (4), _kore tabenai no_, the particle _no_ functions to pass the unrecovered predication to the listener. Although it may appear similar to an interrogative particle, its function is distinct from particles such as _ka_ or _ya_. It leaves open the possibility of subsequent interpretation in terms of reasons, evaluation, or circumstances, and thus presents the utterance within an interactive space rather than closing it as a definitive statement.

In contrast, example (5), _kore zo Nihon danji_, involves strong focalization through _zo_, and the predication is effectively recovered at the moment of utterance. For this reason, adding a polite sentence-final form such as _desu_ results in a clash between immediate assertion and explanatory adjustment. Here again, the issue is not the form itself, but the stage at which the predication is recovered.

These examples indicate that issues surrounding _kakarimusubi_, attributive forms, and realis forms cannot be reduced to the presence or absence of specific inflectional categories or grammatical rules. In classical Japanese, these utterance operations were made visible through inflectional forms, whereas in modern Japanese they are realized through sentence-final particles, intonation, and other means. What remains consistent is a mode of utterance in which predication is not immediately completed, but held open for subsequent development or interaction.

## 3. _Kakarimusubi_ as a Change in Visibility and Its Implications

Attributive-form endings and realis forms triggered by _koso_ can both be treated as different implementations of utterance operations that involve the immediate recovery or suspension of predication. From this perspective, _kakarimusubi_ should not be regarded as a grammatical phenomenon that historically disappeared, but as an utterance principle whose visibility has changed over time.

The operations associated with _kakarimusubi_ - maintaining predication without completion and opening it to subsequent development or interlocutor response - have remained consistent from classical to modern Japanese. What has changed is the form through which this principle is expressed, and the level at which it has been described.

In classical Japanese, this principle was explicitly realized through inflectional forms such as the attributive and realis forms. However, because these structures depend heavily on spoken language, they gradually became difficult to capture within grammatical descriptions based on written sources. As a result, _kakarimusubi_ fell outside the scope of grammatical description and came to be summarized under the label of "disappearance." This should be understood not as the loss of the principle itself, but as a shift in descriptive focus away from discourse-level and immediate aspects of speech.

This perspective also has implications for Japanese language education. While grammatical instruction tends to focus on completed sentences, expressions that convey continuation, suspension, or unrecovered predication are rarely treated systematically. Nevertheless, non-native speakers who acquire Japanese through everyday interaction often come to use such expressions naturally. This suggests that these utterance principles function independently of explicit grammatical instruction, emerging through interaction and speech processing. Discussion of educational applications is therefore limited here to indicating this possibility.

From this viewpoint, _kakarimusubi_ should not be confined to the past as a closed grammatical phenomenon, but re-situated as an immediate principle of utterance production. Making this principle visible again has the potential to offer new perspectives not only for the study of classical Japanese, but also for the analysis of modern Japanese and for descriptions used in Japanese language education.

## 7. Conclusion

This paper has reexamined the traditional view of _kakarimusubi_ as a grammatical phenomenon that disappeared in the history of Japanese, and has proposed instead that it be understood in terms of continuity in principles of utterance production. _Kakarimusubi_ is not a rule governing specific inflectional forms, but an operation that holds predication open and directs it toward subsequent development or interlocutor response.

In classical Japanese, this principle was made visible through attributive and realis forms, while in modern Japanese it is carried forward through sentence-final particles, utterance-final forms, and intonation. Accordingly, rather than explaining _kakarimusubi_ in terms of disappearance, it is more appropriate to regard it as a change in visibility resulting from the limits of surface-oriented grammatical description.
