### Summary

To read the _Ise Monogatari_ solely through the lens of "Heian customs," "male-dominated society," or "polygamy" is to risk missing its true brilliance. What reaches us across more than a millennium is not a fossilized set of customs, but the vibrant emotional exchanges between people: sincerity, deception, mischief, and embarrassment—all of which resonate just as powerfully today.

### Main Text

"It was the Heian period." "Society was patriarchal."—these are the kinds of statements that can shut down our ability to read _Ise Monogatari_ as a living story.

But people are people, in every age. They fall in love. They joke. They deceive. They excuse themselves. They hide behind embarrassment. That hasn't changed in a thousand years.

So we should read these characters not as historical archetypes, but as people who feel as we do. In fact, we must read them that way—because that is where the power of _Ise Monogatari_ lies.

He was tricked—but maybe it wasn't so bad.
She knew—but pretended not to.
He watched—but she let herself be heard.

These are human moments. They deserve to be read with empathy, not overwritten by generalizations about period customs or social structures.

At the heart of _Ise Monogatari_ is not "what the era was like," but how people reached out and touched each other—sometimes with honesty, sometimes with performance, but always with feeling.
