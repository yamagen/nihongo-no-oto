_A reflective notebook on the Japanese language_

**Nihongo Notes** is a project of personal essays and research-style reflections on Japanese language, grammar, and expression.  
It draws from translation work (_Ise Monogatari_, _Tosa Nikki_), the AEAD project (An Expression A Day), and experiences in Japanese language teaching.

> Some words are too immediate to be taught.  
> Some expressions only appear in the moment.  
> This is a notebook for remembering those sounds of Japanese.
